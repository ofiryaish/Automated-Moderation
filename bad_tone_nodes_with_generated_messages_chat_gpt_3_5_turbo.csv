For the purpose of my argument, treat the fetus as full grown adult person with years of experience. But let me show my line of thinking. Because believe it or not, I have dealt with it myself, as I held similar views to yours. Imagine scenario in which woman is raped. And she has to deal with the hassle of having the rapists baby. Potentially rapist having acces to her baby, and to her life (crazy right?). So the woman says ,no. I can't deal with that. I want an abortion. I do not want the baby. At this point a pro-lifer would say. Well, woman has some natural obligations to her baby. After all we don't want to just kill the baby for no reason OTHER than immediate physical danger on the womans life. (disregarding the dangers of pregnancy that can't be classified as immediate danger, and disregarding the physical and mental change of what pregnancy does). Pro-lifer is basically saying. I'm sorry, but this is how it is. This is how nature(God) meant it. A woman is at some level a slave to her biology. She has obligation to the ""greater good"". She must have her body used for some time, in order to satisfy (some morality, or obligation). This is the immoral part. Because today we have technology that removes the natural requirement of slavery of the woman's body. (and we had this technology for couple of thousands years BTW). It's even in bible (I will clarify more if you want). We don't need to have woman bring the baby to terms anymore if she doesn't want to. Woman is no longer required to satisfy her moral obligation to the society (another immoral doctorine in my opinion). She just doesn't have to.

I see that many in here are willing to concede that life begins at some point in the pregnancy, though they deny that personhood impacts their pro-choice leaning. If it is a person in the woman's womb and they have all of the rights thereby endowed, we must read only so far into our country's history as to read these words: ""We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are **Life**, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness"" So we must admit that the person has an unalienable right to life.

I used the term deliberation to mean *in addition* to being a person. They are separate concepts, though it might be thought of that only *persons* actually deliberate. It's an attribute of *personhood*. Notably a *person* does not need to be a human. Whatever it is it just needs to be able to demonstrate those attributes that make *persons persons*.

I successfully did that by providing a source that demostrates that. You've provided no counter this fact and likely won't be able to. The best you've said is along the lines of: you don't care what philosophers think because the field is stagnant. Which does nothing to disprove the source I gave that shows that what I'm saying is correct. However we're also having a continued discussion on compatibilism, incompartibilism, and free will. None of which I really need to support nor tear down because it's already well-discuss in the field and literature. I'm really just trying to get you to understand that referring to this debate as mere definitional or semantic in nature is a gross misunderstanding, and mischaracterization of the debate.

However, I'm not denying there aren't arguments in favor of incompatibilism. There's a number of ""high profile"" and published on-topic philosophers that support that position. Take a look at Pereboom and Searle as well for arguments in support of that. I never denied that incompatibilism could be true, either. In fact I specifically told you I was here merely to tell OP to take your unproven assertion with an appropriate grain of salt given the majority of the philosophy field which doesn't agree with that position. <quote> You are making a positive claim. You are saying we have free will. You must a) define it, and b) provide substantive evidence which supports your definition. You've done neither of these things.</quote> I'm saying a majority of philosopher's believe we have free will. This majority believes that compatibilism is a workable theory that explains said free will. It certainly has been defined. In our conversation you've even tacitly agreed to use that definition. Please stop repeating this. If all you're going to do is put your fingers in your ears and say ""define it! define it! you haven't defined it yet!"" despite the obvious situation that it *has* been defined then we can probably be done. You're clearly not interested in the substantive issues here instead preferring to play word games. With regard to your ""positive claim"" nonsense: that's not how this works. When considering those things to believe in (both in the ""positive"" and ""negative"" sense) first and foremost we need to consider the *reasons* that support them, either way. In the case of free will it's obvious and uncontentious that it seems like we have free will: we use deliberation to make conscious and conscientious decisions to take actions that affect the world. Given this obvious seeming it will take a substantive argument to assert that we don't actually have this ability (when it's clearly obvious that we seem to). So, in actuality you're going to need very strong arguments to defeat that seeming. In the specific case of compatibilism that very strong and obvious seeming is preserved and readily explained (not too far from what I mentioned): free will, that is, concerning the agency to attribute actions to a person and them to be responsible for them, is explained such that because a person deliberates, thinks, and makes informed, rational decisions about the future, their personhood, and value systems (and not coerced by a 3rd party) is said to be *free* (or have *freedom*) and thus exercises free will.",197,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,"[198, 197, 180, 179, 178, 177, 176, 174, 173, 172, 171, 170, 169, 168, 167, 166, 165, 158, 151]","Hello FliedenRailway,

I'll only remind you that this is retread from where we began. I wouldn't think less of you, of course, just that you've fallen into the typical pattern of defensiveness at your intuitive notion of what ""free will"" means **to you** in the unexamined sense. And that's okay. You're always welcomed to your opinions. However if you want to join the academic debate on the important issues at hand in the free will debate you're always welcomed. To continue to ""define away"" the substantive issues will do nothing for your attempts at persuasive arguments and obviously gain the ire of folks who know what they're talking about. Yes, that's terribly insulting but I don't how else to put it to someone who outright rejects even the **attempt** at understanding the current thought in the debate. I thought we had a breakthrough with the personhood thing when you went along with the free will definition and the personhood understanding and even argued against it — which was great! But in the end it's clear you're not actually open understanding, rather just asserting what you intuit to be true. So perhaps this is where we part. No doubt you'll chalk this up to someone who 'just doesn't understand the science' or whatever designation you'd like to assign. And that's cool. It really is a really popular opinion — a sort of hyper-skepticism/scientism — at the moment. So it's a sign of the times at the moment. Again that's quite insulting and dismissive but I other than your granting of the free will and personhood definitions (and an ultimate condemnation) you've really not presenting any case, evidence or support for a lack of free will in any substantive sense. And that's the problem: many contemporaries want to argue for a lack of free will but have zero accounting for all the reasons *why* free will exist. In other words there aren't many compelling reasons why our conception of free will is wrong. If you have a good reason or set of reasons I assure you the **majority of philosophers** want to hear it. Otherwise your scientism simply lacks substance and I'm not sure it contributes anything to meaningful debate on the subject. For the record: I count myself as a hard determinist. If the **understanding** (i.e. theory, not the *definition*) of free will includes the notion of Principal of Alternative Possibilities then free will is impossible.

I'd like to point out court cases very common in our modern society of competing technological corporations, even more so than in the 90s. Looking through records, I could find hundreds of lawsuits against apple, google, amazon, and microsoft. These companies often *do* practice business unethically, and it is up to the court system to deal with the infractions. However, I wouldn't call Gates a ""robber baron"" or call microsoft's monopoly a ""stranglehold."" A lot of the accusations the microsoft received in the 90s stemmed from the sheer amount of innovative technologies the company had control over. Windows, office, internet explorer, and outlook weren't stolen technologies; they were mostly homegrown innovations. Whether or not it was fair for Microsoft to effectively force users to use their products was an issue decided by the courts. You seem to be mistaken in your claim that microsoft's domination was a stranglehold. You refuted yourself by bringing up examples like google, apple, amazon, etc. As an example, Apple has had hundred of lawsuits levied against it, most of them, I believe, justified. Does this make Steve Jobs a ""robber baron""? Does this mean Apple had a ""stranglehold"" on the early smartphone market? No and no. I enjoy microsoft and apple products.

While both genders are capable of being condescending know-it-alls, the particular scenario this term describes is one in which the man derives his authority from being a man, not just from being smarter. A good example would be congressional hearings or decisions on abortion, made almost exclusively by old men. These men, in explaining their reasoning, are mansplaining because there's no rational cause to believe they better understand how it feels to have a woman's body and make decisions regarding it. When they do so, it's because they live in a society that implicitly allows them to tell women what's good for them. Women are rarely if ever allowed the same thing. We're still largely stuck in a model that encourages men to be assertive and women to be acquiescent (this is changing, but we're not done). Thus, the term only exists for men.

But even if it were what I said, I think it depends a lot on what you mean by 'criticize'. Do you equate criticism to punishing or having negative consequences for them? If so, then I agree with your implication that it is right for us to 'criticize' them for their actions. However, if by 'criticize' you mean something along the lines of telling them that 'you know better than that and you need to use more self control' or 'you did a bad evil thing and next time you should just not do a bad evil thing', I actually do believe we should *not* criticize them. I both agree and disagree with the notion that all we have to go off is their actions. While yes, the only thing we can directly observe is their actions, we can choose how we process and analyze those actions. Ultimately, instead of telling them they are bad and thus they have to live in a concrete cell for the rest of their life, we should be having professionals analyzing their behavior and making a medical diagnosis. We should then treat their psychological or neurological disease, if possible. We should still keep them in prison, though we should also improve the living conditions of our prisons. Also, up until about a year ago I would have agreed that we can't know for sure who has it worse in their head. Then I met a friend of mine who has... Something. He's incapable of sticking to a schedule, and his psychiatrist had a policy of refusing sessions if he missed a certain number of them, so he never actually got diagnosed. But when talking to him, he seemed to have a lot of very normal and common fears. For me, those things would be passing, fleeting thoughts that wouldn't last but for a few seconds. Easy to dismiss. For him, however, they lingered. They gnawed at him. And they came to mind every single minute he was awake, all of them, all the time. He KNEW they should be fleeting thoughts and not to dwell on them. But he was incapable of doing that. He was literally incapable of just letting a thought go. I gave him a lot of perspective on things, a lot of ideas, and a lot of it was stuff he hadn't heard before or considered, and he thought it'd help him a lot. It didn't. His problems persisted and continue to persist. He's seen several doctors, psychologists, and psychiatrists; but he's not been able to stay with any particular one long enough to get a diagnosis. But the fact that he had precisely the same intrusive thoughts as I do, but much more extreme and worse, kinda proved to me that we *can* tell who has it worse in their head. He and I both had about the same success rate when attempting personal projects or passing classes at school, too. So as far as actual actions go, we are fairly equal.

But if the same business owner instead resided in Portland, Oregon, he would not be acting immorally at all for not collecting sales tax.

That base reasoning, that base concept that the law in question is based on, that is what makes failing to do so immoral.

Law is too complex and has too many different situations and edge cases such that you can make a generalization stating that if you break the law you are, in general, immorally advantaging yourself at the expense of the rest of society. My point is that in some cases, you are correct, breaking the law immorally advantages yourself in some way at the expense of society. But in those cases it's not breaking the law that is immoral, it's the part where the action you took was **immorally advantaging yourself at the expense of society** which was immoral. I think our entire argument could be summed up in this causation difference. You are assigning the immorality to the specific act of breaking the law, whatever the law may be assuming you personally believe it to be a fair or neutral law, while I am assigning the immorality to the actual action or behavior you took which was against the law, rather than the actual act of breaking the law. I believe that following or not following the law is, itself, always morally neutral. Law holds no moral weight by itself and only serves to *codify* a particular set of moral beliefs. In most cases it's generally pointless to discuss or even bring up whether something is illegal or not when discussing morality because the law is only vaguely related to morality.

Here are some objective theories of morality: act-utilitarianism. Rule-utilitarianism. Virtue ethics. Kantian deontology. Divine command ethics. Justice-as-fairness. Each of these theories of morality is *objective*, in that it takes moral statements to be evaluable based on standards outside those of the person doing the evaluating.

You think that for a moral system to be ""objective"" it has to be totalizing, universal, and able to be conclusively proven by logical argument. But that isn't the case at all. An ""objective"" standard of morality is one by which moral acts are to be judged by reference to external facts and rules. So act-utilitarianism, for instance, is an objective morality. I'm not saying it's *decisively correct*. But that's not relevant to the question of whether it's objective. <quote> It seems you have the reasoning backwards. Because it is immoral to not pay your fair share back to society, we codified the tax code into law, not the reverse.</quote> And then, **as a consequence of this codification**, it is immoral not to pay your fairly-decided-upon taxes. It's **you** who has the reasoning completely backward. Why do we have tax laws? Because we want people to pay their fair share (note: obviously this is not a universal historical truth, but we'll pass over that). Why do you have to pay **this much** tax rather than **that much**? Because the precise mechanism by which we determine, cause, and justify what your 'fair share' is is the tax law. <quote>My point is that in some cases, you are correct, breaking the law immorally advantages yourself in some way at the expense of society.

Also, I would argue that utilitarianism is still not an objective morality (by your definition) because while it sets the standard of ""greatest good"" for determining morality, it doesn't provide any standard for comparing one happiness to another and thus relies on subjective scales of what creates more ""good"" or ""happiness"", but that's neither here nor there. <quote> An ""objective"" standard of morality is one by which moral acts are to be judged by reference to external facts and rules.

Just because you involve a reference to some external facts or rules does not make the entire thing objective if ultimately it still comes down to an internally subjective assessment. What makes something ""external"" anyways? But again, I think this steps away from the discussion and I think I see where you're coming from here, though I'm not sure how that disputes my argument. Other people pointing to some external set of rules as the source of their morality doesn't change my point that what is moral is entirely subjective. The fact that there is no ""Decisively correct"" morality is the point I'm trying to make. <quote> And then, as a consequence of this codification, it is immoral not to pay your fairly-decided-upon taxes.

If we didn't codify it and there was no punishment for evading taxes, but we all agreed that people *should* do so, wouldn't it still be immoral if you decided to not pay your fairly-decided-upon taxes? Why does simply adding a legal punishment to it make it immoral? <quote> ""Why is it immoral to pay 6% tax instead of 7% tax? Because it's immorally advantaging yourself at the expense of society.

The first clause is that paying 6% instead of the agreed upon 7% tax would be advantaging yourself at the expense of society. By simple logic we can deduce that paying 6% instead of 7% is immoral due to the transitive property. (A is immoral. B = A, B is immoral also). <quote> It is specifically the existence of that law that turns your action from morally fine to morally wrong.</quote> No. Its specifically the existence of a social contract that one should pay taxes which are agreed upon if they are fair that makes not paying them immoral.

The immorality of the law can outweigh the immorality of lawlessness.</quote> But at that point, if we've established that when you break the law what determines whether or not it is immoral is whether or not **the action you are taking is itself moral** and if the action you would have to take to follow the law would be immoral makes it moral to flout the law, then the mere existence of the law has no bearing on the morality of the action. If you drew up a truth table involving the morality of the law and the morality of the action in question and the ultimate morality of what you do, you find that the law isn't actually relevant in determining the morality of the action. If the action is moral and the law says it is permissible, then following it is moral. If the action is immoral and the law says it is permissible, then following it is immoral. If the not taking an action is immoral and the law says you cannot do it, then it is moral to do the action despite the law. In all of these cases, what the law said was permissible or not had no bearing on the ultimate morality, rather the morality of the action in question is what decided it. <quote> Have you really never encountered a situation where something can be generally true, but false in specific cases?

I believe that much of the controversy surrounding this entire issue stems from a lack of basic literacy in constitutional laws and rights. When adult college students violate the rights of others by screaming in the audience of a scheduled speaker, they are clearly in the wrong because that is far outside of what is protected by free speech rights. When those screamers carry the mistaken impression that this is an exercise of their rights, that pretty much ensures that we aren't going to make a lot of progress.

I stated that public venues should be allocated based on demand for the speaker from students. You say that will drown out minority opinions. I gave an example where the college republicans demand a speaker and reserve a venue for him. You interpret that as ""People can have guests to their meeting space"". I clarify that I'm talking about reserving a venue from the school. I've already said that the school should provide it based on demand from the aforementioned students. Then, you take things back to square 1, and argue about the criteria for being allowed the venue. I've already told you my ideal criteria for being allowed a venue! This is getting pretty frustrating because *you* sometimes fail to follow along. You take things as stand-alone statements, raising issues I've already refuted or conceded. I've already clarified the difference between how I consider private and public universities. Private universities can do whatever they want, but publicly funded universities shouldn't discriminate based on politics. <quote> Do people have the right to a platform?</quote> There are different kinds of platforms. You don't have the right to a privately funded platform. In the case of a public platform, assuming we're talking about political speakers, you have a right to it depending on your ability to fill seats. It's a bit complicated. You have the right to an objective, rather than subjective, process for procuring a platform *insofar as your opponents are given that same process for procuring a platform*. Things don't happen in a vacuum. Liberal speakers also come and talk. You have the right to speak to students who want to listen if your political opponents are given the same thing. <quote> It does. You are arguing that because one campus group might invite a speaker to a venue, so too must all campus groups receive equal treatment. If the campus publicizes the event, it is discrimination if it doesn't happen for other people. </quote> I have said that the campus faculty shouldn't be the ones to publicize events. I fail to see the contradiction. <quote> Wrong.</quote> Here is your statement: ""You have the right to speak, but you do not have the right to resources that make your speech effective"". I have outlined my view on this in a lot of depth in this comment. It is only 100% true regarding private platforms. <quote> Politicians barely come into it</quote> They are making the decision to fund organizations which make specific decisions.

To me it seems you want to post whatever biased source you want. From my perspective, posting such a biased source says less about the truth of the matter and more about the narrative you've swallowed.</quote> I posted the source because they have video evidence. I posted it because it provides proof. Not all sources is always right, and very few are always wrong. I told you not to bitch about the source only because I knew that you would make ad-hominem attacks. All sources are biased, and the fact that you're pointing out that *this* source is biased indicates to me you don't care about evidence.

At the time of that statement, we hadn't established the private vs public argument. So I'm not sure why you're bringing it up. I don't understand why you can't at least admit I disproved one specific statement. <quote> Now that you have been called out, you don't mind the contradiction?

Universities are not the place for partisan politics, they are a place of knowledge. It is not to put you in touch with some comedians rhetoric.</quote> One important piece of knowledge is about your opponent's rhetoric, so you know how to debate it. How can you possibly teach about politics without teaching about the different positions? The university is already a place for partisan politics, whether we like it or not.

There is no scenario in which the woman can become a parent without having the responsibility of caring for that child other than adoption.</quote> Okay? Same difference? And just because a woman chooses to continue her pregnancy after the man says he doesn't want to be a parent, shouldn't negate his wishes to not be responsible for a child he doesn't want to have. Just like a woman's choice to not be a parent is not predicated on whether or not a man wants to be. She gets the choice regardless. If she continues the pregnancy and decides to be a parent, why should that impact the man's wishes? That's her choice, nobody else's. What are you saying; that men should be held responsible for women's choices, why? <quote>Yes. Because that is the last point where their choice affects whether a child will exist or not. The woman has longer to make the child not exist. If she neglects that child if it ISN'T aborted, she'll go to prison.</quote> So, she has the choice not to be a parent even after conception. Men should have that choice, too. If she chooses to not have an abortion and not go through an adoption process, then she is choosing to be a parent. If she neglects her child after choosing to be a parent she should go to jail. If a man chooses to be a father and uses his right to be in his child's life, and then neglects the child he should also go to jail. And choosing to have sex is not choosing to be a parent for women, so it shouldn't be for men. <quote>A right is not taken away. A responsibility is added.</quote> BOTH PARENTS have a legal obligation to the child. If she keeps it but does not feed it, clothe it or get it medical care, she'll go to prison. Failure to pay child support is mild in comparison. A right is taken away. Because women are not forced to be parents after conception. They still have the choice to not be a parent. What are you not getting? Why should men not be allowed to still have a choice after conception just like women? You're literally arguing for a sexist system. Exactly! If *SHE* keeps it. If she chooses to be give birth to a child, that is her choosing to be a parent. That is her decision. That should have no impact on a man's right not to be a parent when he doesn't want to. Just because you choose to be a parent should not give you the right to force somebody else to be against their will. What are you talking about, dude? If she fails to provide for the child she chose to have that is her sole responsibility, and she has to face the consequence for that choice. The man didn't make that choice. <quote>Except IT ISN'T FUCKING EQUAL. There is no scenario under which a man can be stuck as the sole parent to a child without them deliberately choosing to take custody.</quote> What does that mean??? What does that have to do with equality? If a woman chooses to continue her pregnancy and have a child, who else deserves to be stuck with responsibility and consequences of that decision? <quote>Yet that is EXACTLY what happens to any woman whose boyfriend uses this option. She is still going to be a parent, there is still a child who she will be imprisoned if she fails to care for. But she does not get to choose whether that custody is hers. It is, unless she is willing to give the baby away</quote> She chose to be a parent. Nobody can make that decision for her. Your solution is to force men to pay for the choices of women... cause reasons? I don't understand it. I don't know about your country, but in mine and most of the western world, I believe, you cannot force a woman to give birth, or not give birth. It's solely her choice. <quote>You are effectively giving men a get out of parenthood free card.</quote> I only wish to give them the same cards as women. <quote>You are literally making ALL responsibility for this situation the woman's problem.</quote> Uh, yes. In the scenario you're talking about, yes. When adults make decisions they and them alone should be held responsible for that decision. I don't think people who didn't make that choice should be held responsible for soembody else's choice. It seems some ingrained bias is making you see this situation differently. Men AND women should be held to adult standards. And that means facing the consequences of the choices you make. I don't know what it says about you that you think women shouldn't have to take responsibility for their actions. Sounds like how you would view a child or an animal, not an adult, to me. Maybe that's just me. Maybe I'm the only one that recognizes that adult women have agency and should be perfectly capable of dealing with the repercussions of their own actions. <quote>He doesn't even have to worry about birth control. If there is a fuckup, he can cut and run at no cost.</quote> Just like women? After conception they still have the option of cutting and running, as well, do they not? <quote>She is stuck choosing between an invasive medical procedure or a far more invasive process of pregnancy and then whether she will give that child away or just suffer for being unable to afford it.</quote> Men have to accept that if their choice to have sex results in conception that they have no choice in whether or not their child will be born. Women have to accept that their choice to have sex could result in pregnancy. These facts should not negate the rights of the other. Getting pregnant doesn't mean you get to force men to be parents. Getting somebody pregnant doesn't mean you get to force women to be a parents. Equality. Right now only one of those is true. Women get to force men to be parents without their consent after conception. This is unjust. <quote>Your idea of balance literally dumps every negative consequence on the woman's lap with no recourse.</quote> Only if they CHOOSE to be a parent by choosing to not terminate their pregnancy. If you make a choice, you have to live with it. Men can not force you to do anything in that regard. Now I want it to be the same for men. They should not be able to be forced by women into being parents. Just like men can't force women. I have no idea what is so fucking hard about this. Sorry if this is too long.

Then of course there are diseases like the Zika virus or West Nile that they're responsible for as well. Whatever creature responsible for most net human deaths is clearly the most objective measure of ""worse"" in regard to humans life. Your points are largely *your* subjective criteria of what is ""worse"". Let's go over your points one by one anyway though. 1. Mosquitoes are found everywhere at least to the same extent cockroaches are. 2. Cockroaches may he allusive, but thats only because they want to avoid humans. Mosquitoes don't. Honestly it would be a nightmare I'd cockroaches didn't like to avoid humans, because they'd still breed like crazy. You'd just be constantly fending them off much like if you've ever had Asian beetles or boxalder bugs. That sounds much worse to me. 3. Mosquitoes literally are attracted to humans themselves. 4. Mosquitoes may not leave a trail, but they do infect you by feeding. Even if they don't give you a disease you still get itchy inflamed skin. 5. Mosquitoes are most active at night as well, but unlike cockroaches they do in fact face you, and feed on you. Which is worse? The asshole who runs away from you or the one who punches you in the face and steals your wallet? 6. I cede this point. Cockroaches are among the ugliest bastards on the planet. 7. Mosquitoes have an entire industry and the largest non-profit in the world (Bill and Melinda Gates foundation) working to limit mosquito/human contact, and still millions die every year from it. Again it is easier for *you* to avoid their negative interactions. Not humans as a whole. You cite ""well there are a lot of methods to keep mosquitoes at bay.""

I suppose 9/11 must have really confused you...why did so many people make a big deal about a mere privately owned building being attacked, right? You can drop the whole ""Bernie supporter"" act. Maybe you did pretend to support him because it would give the Republicans a better chance to win, but the only thing you can say you liked about him is opposition to an obscure trade agreement that was in negotiation, which just by coincidence just happens to be the one and only place Sanders and Trump agreed. When Sanders campaigned for Clinton and when Sanders called for a probe of Trump's Russian ties, huh, funny doesn't seem like you paid the man any attention. The entire world unanimously agrees who was behind the cyber attacks. Even President Trump acknowledges it was the Russians. Julian Assange criticized the Panama Papers for making Putin look bad, he took a paycheck from Russian state propaganda, refused to publish anything negative about the Russians, and his biggest claim to fame came from Snowden - another person directly tied to Moscow. The guy might as well have a hammer and sickle tattooed on his forehead. No matter how many times you say the linked emails are ""damning"" you have yet to show me any. Let's compare the DNC emails to what the FBI did. 1) DNC is a private organization, FBI a public one. 2) DNC has very little power, FBI has tremendous power. 3) DNC is a partisan organization, FBI a neutral one. 4) Everything from the DNC emails came after Clinton was a lock for the nomination, the FBI did its dirty work while Trump was losing horribly, 5) You can't show any direct effect anything the DNC did, while Clinton's numbers dropped significantly immediately after Comey's interference. If you were a person of principles, and not party over country, you would be far more upset by the FBI than the DNC. Fact remains you can't bring yourself to say one negative thing about Trump and his Russian overlords all while pretending to have preferred a guy who was opposite of Trump on every single issue except an obscure trade deal.",1063,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,"[1064, 1063, 1062, 1061, 1060, 1059, 1058, 1057, 1056, 1055, 1054, 1053, 1052, 1051, 1050, 1049, 1048, 1047, 1046, 1045, 1043, 1042, 1041, 1040, 1039, 1038, 1035, 1012]","Heelspider, please remember to keep the conversation civil and focused on the topic at hand.

Here, I'll be nice and drop it for you. Just show me what the Democrats did that cost him 500,000 votes. Bull shit that Clinton answered a single debate question with such eloquence that half a million people switched their vote. Bull shit that a single negative article about Sanders compared to the hundreds published daily about Clinton cost Sanders 500,000 votes. Point to me what the DNC did that you can say clearly cost Sanders millions and millions of votes or concede the issue. That's only fair. All I'm asking is for evidence of your claim. Something. Give me something at all that shows he lost millions and millions of votes because of it. Did career Democrats prefer a career Democrat over a guy who just joined to run for President and was going to leave the party as soon as the race was over? Of course they did, duh. Do party members have influence over who wins their party's nomination? Of course they do, duh. At some point you can't let your feeling get hurt that water is wet and that gravity causes things to fall. Plus, no offense, but what kind of immature child votes because of hurt feelings? In 30 years when Trump's court nominations give corporations yet another power over your life, you really think you're going to be like ""but 30 years ago I was upset that career Democrats preferred a career Democrat, so this was totally worth it?"" Insane. You're not picking who to give your grade school valentine card to, you're picking the goddamn president of the United States of America. So when it comes to hating the Democrats, you need very little evidence. A handful of stolen emails out of thousands and that's enough for you to make wild, wild leaps. But when it comes to a murderous dictator suddenly no amount of evidence is enough for you to accept the obvious truth. And speaking of hurt feelings, imagine if you had spent 20 or 30 years working for the better of the country, making a fraction of what you could have made in the private sector. And then some upstart comes out of nowhere and calls you corrupt and his followers who have never done shit in politics before all call you corrupt. How do you think those people felt? Or imagine if you were a woman voter who saw your preferred candidate on reddit called a ""whore"" with hundreds and hundreds of upvotes, and then went on to see Sanders supporters attack every powerful female in the Democratic Party: DWS, Barbara Bush, the head of the Nevada Party, heck, even Warren got her twitter and Facebook brigaded with hate posts simply for not endorsing either candidate. Are those people allowed to have hurt feelings, or does the whole world revolve around you? https://www.rt.com/tags/the-julian-assange-show/ Here is Assange getting paid by the Russian state propaganda machine, since you say no such evidence exists. That Assange promised he had evidence to get Clinton indicted (he didn't), that he would turn himself over to the US if Manning was released (he won't), and that his organization is non-partisan and only cares about transparency (released emails to do maximum damage against Clinton, withheld emails that made her look good, and refused to publish what he had on Trump), Christ man everything that guy says is a lie. And you're going to trust his word over everybody's else's, including the person you voted for president? You are clearly just picking what you want to be true and then bending over backwards to rationalize that. But that's understandable. It's got to be hard to realize that you did exactly what a murderous dictator of an enemy of our country manipulated you into doing. That's a tough lesson to learn. I honestly don't expect you to admit it to me but deep down that has got to bother you. Especially since limited corporate power was your number one concern and he fooled you into the voting for the most pro-corporate president ever. <quote> Because if it wasn't rigging, Bernie would've standed a chance.

Just that too many easily manipulated people like you are willing to let the FBI and Russia interfere with our elections and you just didn't care because it got the result you wanted. And then you have the fucking balls to complain about other people's ethics? So just so we're clear, Clinton after receiving info on the most obvious debate question of all time by a desperate kiss-ass should have gone public with it, getting the poor suck-up fired, in a move that has never been done by any politician ever. She is supposed to be more super ethical than any person to ever run for office. (Remind me again which people Sanders outed for giving him insider tips?) Meanwhile, you don't have the ethics to get upset when the basics of democracy are tossed out the window because it helped the side you liked, a side you liked that went against 70% of your opinions but it was all worth it because poor wittle baby had his poor wittle feelings hurt.

1092,ddrwav8,5tmr76,1487168270,One_Winged_Rook,"Okay, just to be clear, this has now become, solely, which party is in line with western values, and not ""who's more likely to secede"" or who would win in that scenario... Western values, as espoused and won on the battlefield from our previous rulers, in Independence Hall and by our increased influence over the western world, as holding certain truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal and are endowed by their creator with in-alienable rights, among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. That is a western value. I'm not even Christian, but the belief in a creator is fundamental to ""western values"" because that's the only way you can appreciate *rights*. Without a creator, rights are just a list of things some dudes wrote down. It is western, that these rights are not granted to us by men, but merely identified by them as being given by the creator. With that said, let's discuss your issues with the modern right. With regards to bundy, if he was stealing, why wasn't he arrested and charged with that offense? He was charged with conspiracy and other nonsense that only happened *after* they sent men with guns after his cattle. Would have been easier if you numbered your points, so I'm going to use numbers anyway and you can do the work! Point 1 - it is a western value to question what we think is not right. We are a men of talk and reasoning with each other. There is no special rule here that judges are not to be questioned, even in their legitimacy. When it comes to questioning legitimacy, a single line of ""so-called"" is somewhat overwhelmed by thousands of Americans declaring ""not my president"" Point 2 -you mentioned voter suppression, okay, but then follow it up by voter fraud. Yes, both sides think they aren't getting the votes they should be. The left does not have a better claim to this. Point 3 - I'll agree here. The right is much more dismissive of mainstream press. BUT it's not like anyone, that I've heard anyway, is saying people shouldn't be able to write what they want (short of liable) or report on what they want (short of slander). There's no contingency I know of that calls for the imprisonment of reporters for writing biased articles. Point 4 - again, I'll concede your point. I'm not religious and want religion out of government too. Keeping religion out of government isn't some western ideal though. Point 5 - their use of their utility is western. Would you prefer to march in the army and force them to legislate? They were operating under the rules. Point 6 - you're just getting ridiculous. I hope you just read it again and redact it. Point 7 -maybe I missed something, when did law enforcement pick winners? Point 8 - I'm looking at North Carolina right now. We had a different governor on Nov 7th last year than we do now, I don't recall any violence?

For example, this Gallup poll taken in 2010 shows that 40% of Americans accept young earth creationism: http://www.gallup.com/poll/145286/Four-Americans-Believe-Strict-Creationism.aspx - more than the ones who accept the various pseudoscientific branches of creationism, like intelligent design and the rest (at 38%). So a large portion of creationists reject evolution strictly based off the bible - not an issue of scientific evidence, just an issue of religious dogma period. Now, you may not personally believe this one, but it is a complete fallacy to suggest that this is a minority belief, when in fact its acceptance is greater than any other philosophy, including stuff like intelligent design and theistic evolution. --- On the other end of the spectrum, you have stuff like intelligent design and theistic evolution. These other branches are basically ""science is correct on how we were made and the age of the universe except we're just going to tack on an extraneous, unprovable creator god at the start of the explanation"". This is also pseudoscientific and based heavily on religious dogma, because of the *burden of proof* issue. By default, if you propose a theory, you must assume it is IMPOSSIBLE and then PROVE the likelihood of its existence - this is called disproving the null hypothesis. The theory of evolution works because we have carefully sorted through the gathered evidence and determined that no other theory explains the diversity of life on earth quite as effectively.

Is the statement they made with their ineffectual vote not worth making when held against the possibility of making a difference?</quote> Whether or not voting third party is a good idea depends on your goals. The problem with voting third party is that it means that in the race between the two main candidates, the one you like less is getting an extra vote. If you like C best but like A better than B, then voting for C instead of A gives B an extra vote. But maybe you think showing support for someone outside the two-party system is worth having B as president. That's a valid position to take (I disagree, but I still see why rational people would take this position), and in that case you should vote third party. However, refusing to vote at all isn't making a statement, because people don't know why you didn't vote. If you vote for Candidate C, politicians look at the results and say, ""some people voted for C, and that means we can appeal to those people by being more like C.""

Whether or not you have a blank is a matter of chance, not choice. Furthermore, what you have in your gun will not influence whether or not the person dies. The guy with the blank is not trying to stop the person from being killed. But someone voting against eating Joe is actively trying to stop Joe from being eaten. Abstaining means just sitting by and watching it happen. Now, if you can convince the rest of the group that this isn't something we should vote on, that Joe has a right not to be eaten even if we want to eat him, then go for it. That's obviously better. But if the rest of the group insists on holding a vote and sticking with the results, your only way to save Joe is to vote for his life. If you abstain, then you've just sat by and let everyone kill him. Is your conscience happier with ""well I didn't participate"" than with ""I did everything I could for him""? There is a famous [Desmond Tutu quote](http://www.goodreads.com/quotes/7424-if-you-are-neutral-in-situations-of-injustice-you-have): ""If you are neutral in situations of injustice, you have chosen the side of the oppressor.

Here in the UK, there are charities that are gaining ground when it comes to raising the issue of male suicide and depression, male cancers and male victims of domestic violence. Those things aren't right, but these groups and charities don't spend their time demonising feminists and fighting their advances. MRAs on reddit are not really about solving problems, but hating feminists and feminism, most of the time without any understanding of what feminism actually is.

Some young women will complain of a bulge in their underwear and an uncomfortable feeling with certain kinds of tight fitting clothing or when they are doing activities such as riding a bike, running, horseback riding or other kinds of activities that can cause rubbing of the genital area. Enlarged labia can cause irritation, discomfort, and pain in the crotch area. Irritation around the vaginal area can also be caused by chronic vaginal yeast infections, and large labia tend to hold extra moisture and bacteria often times resulting in more Urinary Tract Infections (UTI’s).

(But this is *not* the case with infibulation as that increases the rates of UTIs). And the same maybe goes for other infections and STDs. 6: Cunnilingus (oral sex) with women can give a man **HPV** (human papilloma virus) and this can trigger **throat cancer** in the man.

I'll sidestep all of your ad hominem attacks because I know this is a tense subject and emotions often flare unexpectedly. <quote>okay first the fact that you followed ""source?"" with the use of the phrase ""vast majority"" with no source of your own is pretty galling.</quote> It's a simple fact that circumcised people from cutting cultures tend to be glad they were cut. In countries such as Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Somalia where girls are circumcised, the circumcised *women* themselves are often the most ardent defenders of the practice, and they cite all the same myths, such as that ""it's cleaner"", ""it looks better"", ""it makes childbirth easier"", ""it's healthier"", ""no man will marry you if it's not done"", etc. The point I was trying to make is that cultural bias and lack of knowledge about the anatomical/sexual functions of their genitalia is the source of their defense of child genital cutting, because this is EXACTLY the case in all cutting cultures, USA included, and your bullet points further reinforced this point! <quote>1. people with no nervous sensation in their genitals (due to reasons OTHER than FGM, like spinal cord injury) can experience good sex lives. clearly the ability to experience direct sexual pleasure, while certainly not something i would like to lose, is not a requirement for a self-identified good sex life</quote> Yes! Exactly! Sex still feels wonderful (although I'm not sure about your extreme example about spinal cord injury, where 100% erogenous sensation is removed. That is not the case in even the most extreme forms of FGM.) <quote>if sexual sensation is disabled or blunted before sexual maturity then its absence may never be noted</quote> Yes! Exactly my point! Bravo. People who were born blind say they do not miss the ability to see. Similarly, people who lose their foreskins at birth say they do not miss fully functional genitalia, even as they buy artificial lubrication in heaps and gobs. <quote>the most common cultural basis for FGM is the idea that it is immoral for women to experience pleasure from sex; if you are a woman raised in such a culture, your definition of ""a good sex life"" might be one that involves being a passive recipient without pleasure</quote> Well, I see your point about the true intent of it being to blunt sexual pleasure. But in the case of FGM it's just more explicit, whereas the sex-negative origins of foreskin amputation are just less known and under appreciated. It originated in the USA as a cure for masturbation, the great Jewish philosopher/physican Mamoinades wrote thousands of years ago that the intent is to reduce sexual pleasure and sensation, etc. Ok bro. I digressed and spent more time than I wanted to on MGM/FGM comparison. But I wanted to emphasize that I in *NO WAY* meant to minimize or defend the disgusting practice of female genital cutting, only to point out the Western bias in believing that the majority of FGM are the worst type, committed under the most unsanitary conditions, when in actuality, most moms are taking their daughters to have it done by the doctor. http://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-015-2203-6 But let's move past this whole comparison between female genital cutting and male genital cutting, because I think the *real* reason it's difficult for you to see any parallels is because you believe in some faulty premises: <quote>there is no significant reduction in capacity for pleasure associated with circumcision</quote> Says who? The surveys of men circumcised at birth who were asked to rate their sex lives on a scale of 1 to 10? Based on your own point #2 regarding genital mutilation, people who lose a portion of their sensations before sexual maturity are not really capable of measuring or rating what they have lost. If you do a google search, you will find out that the foreskin is the most sensitive part of the human penis, and the frenulum (usually removed as well, mine was) is the second most sensitive part: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17378847 You just can't really get around this simple anatomical fact that the foreskin is densely innervated with ""fine-touch"" receptors. I was once like most people, and assumed the foreskin was like the skin of the elbow, not even part of the penis, but actually *covering up* the penis like a nuisance or something extraneous. Now I've learned that it's an *integral* part of the penis, it's the surface of the penis, the true tip of the penis (when flaccid), and has evolved to be exquisitely sensitive. <quote>the only thing that foreskin restoration is supposed to - and indeed can - accomplish is to make your dick look uncircumcised again</quote> Not quite. Although one clear goal is to reclaim a natural appearance, there are other things that can be ""restored"" as well: * Restores the gliding mechanism, aka ""rolling bearing"" or frictionless stimulation. This is huge, like having a built-in jerk-off sleeve * Covering the glans so that it de-keratinizes and halts the progression of dulling due to chronic exposure * Restore some degree of moisture/lubrication so that the glans becomes moist and supple again <quote>also, as someone who is a fan of uncut dicks: your natural foreskin is also a ""grotesque skin tube"".</quote> Ok, here's what I meant by that. Your actual foreskin contains all the related structures such as the dartos muscle that draws it close at the tip like a purse string, all of the sebaceous glands, stretch receptors, meissner's corpuscles. But visually, the foreskin is quite sleek and slender, whereas ""restored"" ""foreskins"" are significantly thicker, and frankly, are not your foreskin. It's just not. I so wish it was, but it isn't. If I had an identical twin brother, his would not look like mine, because mine would not be my foreskin but an artificial one, albeit made out of my own foreskin remnant. I hope you can see the difference, and why it was not to be hyperbolic in the least that I referred to it as ""grotesque"". If my ear lobe were cut off, and then I tugged on my ear stump until I grew a new ""ear lobe"" you might call that grotesque, too. <quote>i think you are overselling the hardship here. you wear a tugger that stresses the remaining foreskin tissue in such a way that the tissue slowly grows in surface area. it's like a retainer for your cock, basically. </quote> I'm not exaggerating my hardship. Again, just a few points from someone who has actually been restoring now for 3+ years: * There are devices that can be worn. I own some of them and use them daily. They have to be cleaned every day, sometimes multiple times of day, to get them to grip the skin. * There are multiple ways you have to wear the device, to target different types of remnant. The skin above the scar line that attaches to the glans is the inner mucosa remnant (the inner lining of the foreskin) while the skin below the scar line that attaches to the belly is the outer foreskin remant. Each type of tissue has to be tensioned differently, and it requires much more strategy and foreplanning than you might realize in order to succeed in tensioning these properly. A great deal of education goes into it, you will learn more about the anatomy of the penis than you ever thought possible. * As you succeed in expanding the remnant, your methods also have to change. You have to constantly be reevaluating your regimen * LAST BUT NOT LEAST, for many restorers, it's an emotionally harrowing process. As you become intimately aware of the parts of your penis that were cut off, it can be quite challenging to have it in your face every single day that they are gone forever. Moreover, as skin is expanded and more natural sensations are achieved, especially for me while jerking off, it really hits you in the gut just how natural and normal and wonderful it is to have these mechanical sensations, such as the skin gliding over the glans. I have personally talked to and read the accounts of several other restorers who struggled with this psychological aspect of restoring. On the one hand you are sublimating your grief into something constructive and positive, but on the other hand, you are faced with a poignant reminder on a day to day basis, when it's frankly easier a lot of the time to simply ignore it and not think about it. <quote>. i sincerely doubt that spending the rest of your life dying on this rhetorical hill is going to make you feel any better</quote> I can't grow my foreskin back.

You are, by the way, incorrect here, as far as I am aware - functional foreskin restoration is quite possible. <quote> Circumcision permanently removes tissue that is impossible to regain.</quote> Now, ""easily"" is going to be a subjective term, but as I explained below, in many cases an aesthetically-pleasing foreskin structure can be regenerated in a few years of tugger use. Relative to having your primary sex organ's pleasure center removed - again, if you are a dude, this is the entire shaft of your penis - this *is* easy to reverse. It's been discussed that certain glands and the structure of the frenulum cannot be regenerated with compete fidelity, but here's thing: the foreskin is a flap of skin that covers the head of your penis. That's *all* it does. If there is a flap of skin covering the head of your penis, you have a foreskin, whether it grew naturally or through medical intervention. So in terms of functional tissue, it is absolutely possible to regain. The exact shape of your natural foreskin is much like the shape of your fingernail at any given time- like everything in your body, it is a complex and highly-organized structure, and once it's gone you will never have it again, because the chances it an exact duplicate growing in its place are infinitesimal. But you will grow A fingernail back, just as A foreskin can be regenerated. And, again, the points you have failed to address are still valid: circumcision does not reduce pleasure in any measurable way and it has medical benefits.

That's very sad, and frankly you should think about changing that for the happiness of those around you. I believe it is called ""judgemental"". The foreskin protects the head of the penis. It keeps it most and sensitive. It provides gliding during sex and is pleasurable for both parties. The circumcised alternative is constant rubbing, such can become painful. Furthermore, there are structures such as the frenulum and tyre series of ridged bands at the opening of the penis which help hold the foreskin in place over the glans, protecting it. That, and thousands of nerve endings. When you call it a flap, you leave out all of this. When removed, is absence becomes a painful reminder of special violation. As a jew, your are conditioned find foreskin abhorrent, or at least, see those with one as not having sealed their covenant with Abraham and god. Bla bla religion. Why would god create us in his image, perfect in every way, only then to demand a part of the sex organ be cut off? Makes no sense, like much in the bible. Also, circumcisions performed millennia ago were much less severe than those today. Only when people discovered the skin could be stretched to once again cover the head, hiding the branding of their genitalia, did circumcision become what it is today, a full removal of as much skin as possible. It used to remove only a bit of skin, leaving some of the head still covered, which is less problematic and still allows for some of the benefits and purpose of the foreskin. 120 years ago in the United States, almost nobody except jews was circumcised. Then religious movement and fervor against masturbation kicked in, thanks to Kellogg. Fortunately now, more and more people are seeing it for what it is, a painful, brutal violation of the rights of the child and the man he grows to become. Babies die every year because of circumcision, and countless other complications occur.

Initially generating hundreds of publications in favor. However, several major meta-analysis in 2015 (partially inspired by a few failed replications in 2014) essentially overturned the ruling.

Their consensus is that they should be able to compete if their labs fall within those values, not medical evidence. That WA Post article and its accompanying study is literally about 8 runners on running distances from 5K to 42k. This is not a study about bone density or muscle mass, or even testosterone. It concludes: <quote>age graded scores for these eight runners are the same in both genders.</quote> I see why you may have thought this was a study in favor of there being no differences whatsoever, but it's a stretch and mentions nothing about the things we've discussed being studied. It's about 8 total trans people. This cannot be extrapolated to represent the entire population as the sample size is too small. Even the author says it was hard to find and recruit people for this study. The Fox article, has one doctor that said there is no difference. There is no mention of any supporting scientific study. He does not speak for all physicians. Also, the letter and its contents were said in such a way to fulfill the requirements of her being allowed to compete. That does not mean that the rules are correct. It's what the organization allows for. The cosmos magazine is talking about the study above. Can you please check the sources before sending articles talking about the same study? (It's frustrating having someone write their opinion on the same bad study and I have to look through your source when you claim it's about a different study.) The second study in the article concludes: <quote>The question of whether reassigned M–F can fairly compete with women</quote> depends on what degree of arbitrariness one wishes to accept, keeping in mind, for instance, that similar blood testosterone levels in men have profoundly different biologic effects on muscle properties, rendering competition in sports intrinsically a matter of how nature endows individuals for this competition. I get the feeling that you are agreeing with the article's author's opinions and not reading the studies themselves. Think progress article: Again, please click the sources before claiming they are additional studies. Same exact 8 runner study. The second one is better, but did you read the abstract rather than what the article said? Please read the research you provide first. <quote>Additionally, no trial has been conducted in transitioned</quote> athletes as compared with physically born men and women athletes. As such, there is no concrete evidence to support or refute the position that transitioned athletes compete at an advantage or disadvantage as compared with physically born men and women athletes. Thank you for sending me articles, but none of them contained any of the things we have been talking about in regards to bone density, testosterone's effects on anything or there even being no advantage to being a trans woman competing against cis women.

Google some of those names and you will see that they are experts in their fields and have years of training and education. An argument from authority is acceptable if they are experts in the field and represent a consensus. Since they are all experts in the field and there is a clear consensus among them, you should take into account what they are saying and acknowledge that they have years of education more than you. Is that to say they're definitively right? No, but their opinions carry more weight than yours do and you've yet to show me an expert that contradicts what the IOC is saying. I know about the limitations of the study and it would be tough to put together a study with a large sample size since you have to consider the idea that transpeople make an estimated 0.5% of the population and being at athlete level would even be rarer. I'd also imagine that due to the stigma of being a transgender person, there are still athletes who have not transitioned. Needless to say, you will be hard-pressed to find a sample size and even if you did, it would be nigh impossible to definitively prove that there is no advantage. Meanwhile, we can see things like the effects of race and height on athletic performances, but you refuse to segregate based on that. Here's a study showing that black people are dominating sports: http://homepage.westmont.edu/hoeckley/readings/symposium/PDF/301_400/341.pdf If they are so dominate and you are concerned for fairness, why are we not segregating based on race? Why are we not segregating tall people from short ones when tall people have the advantage in some sports while short ones have the advantages in others? So why there isn't a definitive study saying that they do not have an advantage, any sort of evidence shows that they do not. In lack of any evidence countering this, you are still arguing from ignorance. I would agree that more studies need to be done but you can't take the stance that they should be banned, just the stance that there is not enough evidence to support conclusively one way or the other.

And institution who have big influence, reach and obligation to public (news, movies, literature, radio, TV, etc...) . That is specifically what Christopher Hitchens is talking about. Every one of his remarks are made in regards to governments and regimes. Since that is his area of interest and framework he is talking about. However Free Speech doesnt apply to private institution. Or at least not as much. They are dictating the rules, because they are paying for the platforms they give you. Take reddit for example. Any admin can censor anyone's opinion as they wish. And rightfully so. Moderated discussion is the most productive. Airlines have a strict rules what you can or cannot say in plane or airport. Or even how you can or cannot behave. If you start shouting on plane in air about bomb. Then other people can get angst, can freak out, which can be incredibly damaging in plane.

I think you might be saying that there isn't friendly fire because there IS friendly fire, but people ignore the stuff that's bad, so it doesn't have an effect? (""nobody would pay the troll any mind"") To disprove that, I'd just have to go and find one instance where someone in pol said something like your first example where it was endorsed or supported by someone else. I have no intention of doing this, but as someone who does go into pol (or who deals with twitter trolls) can you honestly say this never happens? Can you back up the idea that everyone is careful to only support when someone trolls someone (you personally think is) silly? More generally, these examples don't ring true to me, partly because what characterizes 4chan-style discourse isn't talking about cowboy hats, it's saying things like ""beano."" I completely fail to see how using that word at all attacks any of the problems you listed in PC culture; that mockery could easily be done without it. Instead, clearly, people say ""beano"" to try to invite others to be mad about it, because genuine emotion is hilarious to trolls. What's being mocked is the very idea that someone would be offended by anything. Could you explain to me how ""no one should be offended by anything"" isn't in opposition to your example of ""that black man is ok to be offended by the police officers treating him unfairly""?",3212,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,"[3213, 3212, 3211, 3210, 3209, 3208, 3207, 3206, 3205, 3182, 3181, 3121]","PreacherJudge, your question about whether there is friendly fire on 4chan and how it affects the overall impact on countering PC culture is valid.

3217,dindtl0,6g243b,1496961582,PreacherJudge,"<quote> This might be where we disagree. When I said ""functional"" I meant that it is a potential way to combat that, not ""the best, perfect way"".</quote> Then your view is so wide, it's almost impossible to argue against. Almost anything is a POTENTIAL way to combat something. The question is, if it's a GOOD way to combat it. And ""good"" includes that it doesn't have bad side-effects. It's not helpful to caricature ""good"" by saying I'm arguing for perfection; I'm not. <quote> It's a trend I often notice, particularly with the PC folks. when you have no argument to stand a core belief on, you lash out with force instead. There's almost certainly a correlation there.</quote> I don't know what you've seen, but I have a very, very difficult time thinking this interpretation has nothing to do with an overarching view that having strong emotions about things is bad (as exemplified by your ""people just need to toughen up!"" rhetoric a couple of messages back). <quote> Again, we're arguing about different things. I'm thinking more like, the guy who goes up to Shia Lebouf and says ""I don't think your art project is constructive"" and get spat in his face and assaulted.</quote> How fair is it to use Shia Le-freakin-Bouf as an archetype for a Social Justice person, really? But also, I don't really see how this proves your point. Lebouf can have acted unreasonably violent AND he could be correct. Those things have nothing to do with one another. <quote> can you unpack that? I don't quite understand that.</quote> I think you said that 4chan people attack social justice people because they're easy targets (i.e. they feel emotions strongly about things that 4chan people themselves don't feel strong emotions about). Do you have reason to believe this is the case, rather than 4chan people disliking social justice people for another reason first, and the trolling-technique of making them angry coming next? <quote> Ok, maybe again we're talking about different things. When I make the distinction, I'm talking about actual harm vs imagined harm. Actual harm is something that affects you physically, financially, legally. Imagined harm doesn't.</quote> You deny the existence or importance of ALL emotional harm? That beggars belief. The concept of emotional trauma is pretty well-known and is not particularly controversial. What seems more likely is that you (and people on 4chan) disagree with social justice people about where the line between ""valid"" and ""invalid"" emotional trauma lies, and you have taken it upon yourselves to enforce the placement of your line to the death. I think I understand your reasons for doing this (you partly explain below), but the thing you're not acknowledging is that you're throwing out a giant baby and a tiny bit of bathwater. <quote> See I don't actually support the ""offense is always bad"" thing. However I do think there is a danger in assuming offense when there's not -- it leads to social harm, false accusations, and real people losing their jobs and even lives without having done anything wrong. Look at all the college professors who get socially (sometimes physically) lynched when they suggest something that doesn't conform.</quote> First of all, ""lynching"" doesn't mean that. Second, the very fact that you have to reference such an extreme scenario..... where the terrible outcome was that *nothing happened to the professor*... appears to undercut your point. The behavior of people at Evergreen is indeed egregious... but it's also not at all representative (if it WAS representative, would people need to grab onto something that happened at a tiny school no one ever heard of?). <quote> That's the kind of outrage I'm talking about, I suppose.</quote> If this is the issue, it strikes me as far more useful to argue against *that kind of outrage* instead of going around calling people beanos.",3216,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,"[3217, 3216, 3215, 3214, 3213, 3212, 3211, 3210, 3209, 3208, 3207, 3206, 3205, 3182, 3181, 3121]","PreacherJudge, it seems like you have raised some valid points and asked for clarification on certain aspects of the discussion.

And there is no perfect solution. Can you explain?</quote> No, ""good"" means it has small or unimportant side-effects. Those adjectives are judgment calls, but ""we're perpetuating actual racism"" doesn't sound small or unimportant to me. <quote> Maybe it does, I'm not sure. Why is this relevant though?</quote> Because it's wrong. If ""acting emotional"" means ""you lose the argument"" then there's a (illogical and unreasonable) way to win any argument. It justifies trolling, but based on a false assumption. <quote> Because of this reaction, I think arguing with someone until they use violence is a good way to make people agree with you. And my CMV is all about sympathy and agreement, not necessarily who's right and who is wrong.</quote> Then you need some perspective about who people really tend to sympathize with when trolls go after someone. Most people don't have 4channy assumptions about the world: they're disgusted by trolls, not the victims of trolls. But again: If you dislike violence, *why are you in favor of attacking anything but violence*? You're not against the subset of PC culture that gets violent; you're against PC culture... I don't know how much I think this violence thing is really at the heart of your views. <quote> And I guess I understand why people might disagree with this. I put freedom of speech as a very important right, and think that it shouldn't just be tolerated but defended (I know the classic argument ""freedom of speech, not free from the consequences of that speech"", but I do think that protecting people who are saying unpopular things is a social imperative for us!). This is a very personal belief I hold, maybe because I have been in the experience of saying unpopular things and changing peoples' opinions by pointing them out.</quote> I think, in terms of values, this is respectable whether nor not I fully agree. But the heuristic ""If people don't want me to say this, then it must be a good thing to say!"" doesn't actually make any sense. It doesn't defend free speech (as you yourself say, consequences to speech aren't restrictions), and the speech in question can be morally bad for other reasons. I guess I just don't see why it's a social imperative to say things people dislike... who's it help? <quote> When at one point in my life I was shut down by screaming and attempted violence I was very upset and stewed over that for months. Even if I was wrong, which I might have been, what right does someone have to dictate what I can and can't say?</quote> But you're (understandably) focused on this experience in a pretty self-interested way. Your words affect people, and that's part of the situation, too. I'm not necessarily in favor of people being shouted down, but it's short-sighted to say these experiences were *only* about what *you* can and can't do. This is where I have to go back to the emotion thing. I'm not sure it can be overstated how important this is here. I feel it's my responsibility to do my best to figure out if someone might get their feelings hurt by what I say and then to use that to gauge the morality of saying it. 4chan, with its mentality of ""toughen up, you baby,"" does not. This isn't the place for an argument about this, but I wanted to point it out because I'm not sure you're aware that the people on 4chan are the unusual ones, here: most people don't like hurting other people's feelings. (As an aside, I don't think 4channers do either, or they wouldn't have cognitive dissonance about doing it by accident.) If you're assuming that ""ha, that Mexican immigrant had her fee-fees hurt!"" will do anything but cause sympathy for that immigrant, you're wrong. <quote> A number of professors all over the western world have to deal with this. Jordan Peterson in Canada, that guy at I think Harvard whose wife said it's ok to wear offensive halloween costumes, etc.</quote> You're running the gamut, yeah. There's a handful of isolated events that people always bring up; the fact that you're still using these same stale examples that have been around for years tells me this is in fact not a big thing. <quote> Sure it was a minor example, but as someone who's graduating this weekend, I had a number of run-ins with the super-PC types at my college. Other people I know have similar stories.</quote> The thing that always gets me here is... can't you just disagree? ""Hey dude, that shit is racist, and here's why."" ""I thought about what you said, and I'm sorry, but I don't agree. Bye!"" What is the problem there? <quote> The problem is that many of these people refuse to debate and argue on your terms. A lot of them believe in postmodernism as a mode for debate -- it's hard to argue with someone who believes that facts are a means for the strong to oppress the weak.</quote> I think this ties directly back in to the ""disparagement of emotion"" issue, as well as the biggest cause of political disagreements in the US today: the fact that liberals focus on the macro level, while conservatives/libertarians focus on the individual level. Because which is more likely: that most people who care about social justice have completely forsaken reason and evidence, or that you are misunderstanding their arguments, don't agree their evidence is meaningful, or are projecting onto them assumptions that they aren't making?

The point is that what you think of as a backlash against PC culture has always been around, and it is always been wrapped in edgy humor, because that is an effective way to attract young people. It's not functional in the sense that history shows there is no way to stop progressivism and change, but it does function well as a hobby: you can pass a lot of time complaining about political correctness, and even make some friends who think similarly to you. Most people involved in the hobby of complaining about political correctness prefer to see their activity as some part of a righteous crusade. In the past society sent young men to die in war, and this desire for combat is still there instinctually, so online you find masses of young men who want the feeling that they are on the winning side of a powerful army that is stopping a force of evil. So within the context of the hobby they invent fictional villains as an outlet for their real-world frustrations: the women who have rejected them, humiliations coming from pressure to conform to masculinity, controlling parents and bosses, the inability to obtain the ideal life shown in the media, etc. All these frustrations exist and people need some kind of outlet. One of the basic ways to feel better about ourselves can be to look down on others. Who needs to examine their own failings, when these ridiculous SJWs are running around saying ridiculous things? There is so much material to be outraged over, you can spend all your time on that instead of on things you would rather avoid, which are perhaps more directly related to your life. So complaining about political correctness online is functional as a hobby to pass time, make friends, enjoy some dank memes, get excited when a well known teenager with purple hair says something dumb to get outraged over, etc. But history (both in the last 20 years and the last 200 years) shows an overwhelming preference for progressivism and the euphimism treadmill (which refers to the fact that we constantly evolve language to be less offensive). It's always tempting to see ourselves as part of a turning point in history, but this is fabricated as an anti-progressive recruitment tactic (this time its different! The SJWs have really gone too far and our army is getting stronger! So righteous, much win!). The reason for this is kind of obvious: people who face discrimination and hate have more of a personal investment than the opposition who just does this as a hobby and has no genuine personal material stake in it.

But under the academic definition, that is a prejudice backed up by power structures, that is literally never going to happen in the western world. Racism against nonwhites has the advantage of a power structure that stretches back for *centuries*. Can you imagine a black/Latinx/Native American power structure arising and subjugating whites in any reasonable stretch of time? And no, not this ""white genocide"" nonsense. <quote> Respond to hate with hate in the other direction</quote> First off, the hatred may flow in each direction, sure, but the *magnitude* is incredibly different. When hatred from entrenched groups is expressed, you get your run-of-the-mill Twitter trolls, but you also get Anders Breivik, Dylann Roof, the Quebec shooter, the Portland stabber, the University of Maryland stabber, the New York City stabber, etc etc etc. Can you name me three murders committed by ""SJW""s? Second, you have to contextualize the ""hate"" expressed by SJWs. Remember that many of them live in a system that *is* stacked against them. They may have experienced many, many slights, both major and minor, directed at them or those they care for. So they vent and get angry and say things like ""die cis scum"" (which afaik is usually a joke). The lashing out of a marginalized group should not be held to the same standard as a group that has traditionally been empowered spewing hatred. Of course, marginalized groups can still go too far, but given context, I'm more likely to give ""SJW""s a pass on that one. <quote> I've met exactly 1 racist, and she's my grandma.</quote> I'm assuming you're American?

Take the [Implicit Association Test](https://implicit.harvard.edu/implicit/aboutus.html) sometime, you might be surprised. There have been a lot of studies done showing that whites have subconscious anti-black biases, blacks have subconscious anti-white biases, and even that *black people have subconscious anti-black biases*. This doesn't mean that everyone is a David Duke, but to quote John Oliver, ""You don't have to be intentionally racist to do things that have racist effects"". This is, essentially, why ""SJW""s focus on white racism, on male sexism, on cis transphobia.

But in general it is a semantic argument -- if that's too confusing, just replace every time I say ""racist"" or ""racism"" with ""person who is consciously discriminatory on the basis of the color of one's skin"" and ""person who consciously discriminates based on the color of skin"" to understand the exact arguments I'm supporting. <quote>And no, not this ""white genocide"" nonsense.</quote> Never brought it up in the first place, and I don't support it or think it's all that convincing.

But many people take it too far, and you know exactly who I mean by this. Also the black person tweeting ""kill whitey"" who is disregarded? A nice story. What actually happens is something like Yusra Khogali, the co-founder of the movement ""Black Lives Matter"", saying stuff like this: <quote>“Whiteness is not humxness, in fact, white skin is sub-humxn,” she wrote. “All phenotypes exist within the black family and white ppl are a genetic defect of blackness.”</quote> [source, though not a primary source and biased/right-leaning obviously](https://heatst.com/culture-wars/black-lives-matter-leader-says-white-people-are-sub-human-and-suffer-from-genetic-defects/) or tweeting out, literally: <quote>“Plz Allah give me strength to not cuss/kill these men and white folks out here today.

These are powerful people that millions listen to, and they have a profound effect on those who listen to them. These are this generation's Malcolm X's, who are *in no way immune to criticism*, and rightfully should not be. And yet I'm criticized for pointing this out. They say I'm a bigot for saying ""Black Lives Matter aren't necessarily the good guys because they're black. I like the main point of the movement but I can't in good faith give money and time to someone who says I'm literally subhuman"". And these same people go out and start shooting cops (that actually happened) because they feel like the only way to retaliate against injustice is by perpetrating their own injustices. That because white people are discriminatory against them they should be discriminatory against white people. This is **wrong**. This is flat out **real bigotry**.

Some people see the natural world and adopt a strange pseudo-scientific morality; ""We're animals, we're not supposed to be monogamous"", and so they aren't monogamous. I don't think there's anything inherently wrong with having multiple partners, but that kind of pseudo-logic is just barmy - it's not logical to claim monogamy is bad just because we're animals. I think a most people have the view that it's good to promote things like happiness, health, prosperity, freedom, liberty, and so on, for all people equally. But it's silly to say ""We're primates, therefore the best way to be happy is to act like other primates"", or ""We're animals, if you're not reproducing you've failed as a human being"", or otherwise making judgements and influencing decision based on faulty reasoning. I want to live in a world where I and my loved ones are safe, healthy, and happy. The best way to accomplish that is to encourage society to be fair, equitable, and prosperous (not to mention secular, free, democratic, etc) - that is, I have the best chance of being happy if my society is one where *everyone* is (or can be) happy. But none of that cares about biology - the fact that I have a penis doesn't mean I should be having sex all the live long day, or that activities that don't lead to sex are fruitless and immoral, or that non-reproductive sex is immoral, etc. My penis, and the penises of others, are irrelevant to my ethics.

3758,djfhwh6,6jlh70,1498504307,[deleted],"Time and time again we see the establishment compromise with moderates for fear of facing extremists. Three hundred years ago, almost every European country was an absolute monarchy. Radical republican revolutionaries rose up all over the world and were decried as godless extremists sworn against the natural order and the divine right to rule. Not every country had a (lasting) republican revolution, but without armed republicanism in the world, constitutional monarchy could never have arisen. When you politely ask the king if he could devolve his divine right to rule and share power with a parliament, you get hanged. The King only accepts parliament if the alternative is losing his head. How did we go from the horrendous working conditions of the industrial era to having weekends, paid holiday leave, limited hours, and workplace health and safety? Was it persuasively worded worker's rights legislation? Or was it the very tangible fear of (outlawed) organised labour movements and socialist revolution? Notice how workers rights drastically improved after union strikes and socialist revolutionaries were a thing. Did colonialism end because oppressor nations listened to the subjugated people's grievances? Or was it the countless armed nationalist movements and mass protests that either transferred control directly back to the local people via revolution, or forced the imperialist nation to begin a process of decolonisation? 'Progressives' rely on radicals to get the establishment into the negotiation room, and they typically only succeed in striking deals that utterly undermine the spirit of the cause they're representing (otherwise the ruling class would never even agree). The progressive method requires decades of persistent campaigning, pushing incremental measures that erode oppression at a snail's pace over the course of generations (a luxury happily afforded by the privileged who don't have to live out their entire lives waiting patiently for positive change). The presence of related radical movements increases the effectiveness of liberal progressivism, but more to the point, radicals further their cause in giant leaps and bounds when they manage to succeed.",3641,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,"[3758, 3641]","[deleted], thank you for sharing your perspective on the role of extremists in social movements throughout history.

I could choose to let other dudes rail me, but that's not what I want or desire which is not a choice - just how I am.

How does the cake variable make it better or worse? <quote>I love when people trot this out. We had a half black President who was treated like shit by the not-at-all-subtle-racists of the country, from the birther morons (our current President included) to regular old school ""I don't think a black person should be president,"" racists. Obama won because young people and black people suddenly voted, for once, and because his opponents *both times* really sucked. Romney could not be less relatable if he tried and McCain had the horrible judgement to choose Palin as a running mate, who then torpedoed their campaign by sheer force of her ignorant comments.</quote> I love it when people downplay and dismiss major accomplishments when they interfere with the emotional pleas they make. Despite your pity party pessimism, the fact remains that we went from Loving v Virginia to a biracial President in a relatively short time. I'm sorry you see that as such an inconvenience. <quote>Even ignoring these things, why would electing a black president mean that racism is somehow over?</quote> I'll give you a chance retract that and properly represent my position. <quote>It's not like everyone in the deep South and religious right woke up and thought, ""Well hey!

He's not allowed to shit in his cakes even though they're ""his"" and he's not allowed to tell people that they cute cancer and he's not allowed to hang a sign that says Muslims can't come in. These are all arbitrary rules.</quote> I love it when the emotional arguments reach for such hyperbole. It shows desperation. <quote>Correct. This is how the economy works. You can't buy everything in the world with your limited money. We also can't prove that you do or don't want a cake in the first place. What we *can* price is that the baker is in the business of selling cakes to the general public and has bought licenses and signed agreements to that effect. These rules were created from scratch by the society because that's how we want to operate.

You are suggesting I don't care about my family. Perhaps because I didn't write an extensive list of every instance of racism we have experienced. My movie is about to start so forgive me lack of research. But didn't you ask about civil rights violations and not just mean words and nasty store owners and employees? <quote>What's your argument here? That it's difficult to prove and therefore we shouldn't even make it policy?</quote> My argument is that the laws you support force people to lie to disassociate with people who disgust them. I would have to lie to stop serving that disgusting bigot. <quote>There vendor has the power because the vendor has the goods and services that people need.</quote> The customer has the cash the vendor needs. So your argument doesn't hold water. <quote>Boycotts work because they make it no longer worth the trouble, but it's not like anyone forced you to do it in the first place.</quote> Boycotts work because of the power you want to pretend the customer doesn't have.

It's called indirect discrimination (or ""adverse effects""): when a specific group is targeted by a rule or policy that merely has the appearance of being neutral. It's like when an employer requires a maximum of 5 years of experience for a job, in order to indirectly weed out the older applicants. On the face of it, it looks like it applies to everyone equally, but it doesn't.</quote> So if I high five every black person in the country, is it no different than if I shoot them all? I think you're confused about what is being said here. Just because the ratio of gay-to-straight people is the same whether you're talking about catering a gay wedding or serving a gay person, doesn't mean those two things are the same. <quote>I'm only objecting against the exaggeration of the role a baker actually takes in the ""sinful"" activities. Functionally, a cake is really only an embellishment to the wedding. The actual marriage (i.e. the creation of the marriage bond) is typically completed before the cake is even touched by anyone; it plays no role in it.</quote> I'm not exaggerating anything. I'm pointing out the difference, and it's a difference that OP has accepted. One is serving a person, the other is serving a person specifically celebrating the thing about that person the baker finds sinful. <quote>There is no real difference. It's not like straight brides and grooms are also disadvantaged if a baker is refusing to cater to gay weddings. By its effects, the act of refusal because of the event being gay is indistinguishable to a refusal because of the customers being gay.</quote> There is a real difference. The problem is apparently the only thing that matters to you is the RATIO of gay people to straight people. So you can't artificially narrow the scope of what the word ""difference"" means and then claim there's no difference. There is a difference and it's obvious. In one scenario gay people can't utilize the bakery in their everyday lives. In the other, they can't utilize the bakery in one specific example. Those things are DIFFERENT THINGS. <quote>I don't know if you support race-based bakery discrimination too, but it would be like saying that you don't serve interracial or black weddings, but you're happy to serve bagels to anyone. A judge will see right through this kind of double talk.</quote> Yes I disagree with similar legislation on race, because I don't think the government has a right to make you interact with somebody, even if you think they're refusing on mean or nasty grounds. <quote>I have nothing against rules or polices that affect all customers equally, such as a prohibition on hateful cake writings, hate symbols (e.g. swastikas), pornography etc.</quote> One of the problems with this is that it is subjective what fits into categories like that. So really what you mean when you say ""affect all customers equally"" is you mean it affects all customers in the way you want, or ""equally"" based on things you care about, like skin color, gender or sexual orientation. <quote>Equal treatment of groups of customers (especially minorities) is a legitimate and moral societal interest, just like hygiene and rules against anti-competitive behavior. I do believe that society should have the right to demand non-discrimination of minorities, because creating a market where everyone is treated equally in comparable situations will create a market where everyone has similar opportunities, which is also better for the market in the long run.</quote> 1. I don't agree that *even if* it's ""better for the market in the long run* that gives you the right to tell people who they have to interact with. 2. It's not *at all* clear to me that these laws do more good than harm. There is plenty of unintended harm in these sorts of regulations in the form of people being afraid to not serve (or employ) somebody based on some protected class status, when maybe they should. For instance, if a group of rowdy young black boys are in your store, you might be wary about kicking them out for being too rowdy because you might get sued. Then what if they end up indeed costing you customers for being too rowdy? I'm not sure exactly how often this happens, but that's the point, it's not calculable.

Are you even listening to yourself? <quote>And I also mentioned financial harm, so that's two types of harm.</quote> Financial harm how? Am I stealing somebody's money?

If you think prevention of aggregate harm is justification for government action, that implies all sorts of terrible things. <quote>The behavior of the baker is not inaction in any conventional sense. ""Harm through inaction"" is usually defined as a situation where someone doesn't cause harm, but allows it to occur or fails to prevent it where he could have. That's not what's happening here.

The fact that no cake was baked might make this seem counter-intuitive.</quote> <quote>The behavior of the baker was both a necessary and sufficient condition to bring about the two types of harm, and these would not have occurred if the baker hadn't behaved that way.</quote> The harm is not caused by the baker because none of this is predicated on the baker behaving in any particular way. Maybe they screamed ""WE DON'T SERVE DYKES, YOU SCUM"" or maybe they wished them the best and gave them the number to other bakers who could help them, but it's against their religion to participate in the wedding, even if they hold no ill-will towards them as individuals. You're against both instances, and the latter can only be described as ""causing harm"" if you abandon all semblance of intellectual honesty. <quote>Yes of course it changes their judgment, but having no anti-harassment laws just didn't make for very safe work environments for women.

It's not part of my justification.</quote> No part of your justification is that the government isn't forcing you to do X because technically you don't HAVE to start a bakery. That isn't a good argument, for the reasons I keep laying out and you keep dodging. The government can't INSERT itself through force into everyday normal human activity and then dictate what I'm allowed to do *without justification.* So all of this nonsense about how people ""choose"" to start a bakery is not relevant. I'm not arguing that the government NEVER has the legitimate right to impose a law or regulation, **I'm saying that the specific law or regulations has to be just, in order to be legitimately imposed.** <quote>Oh, I'll accept that it's about telling someone what they have to do (in very limited circumstances). But it's only in reaction to their voluntary decision to be in such a job. They knowingly exposed themselves to the risk that they would find themselves in that situation (to borrow some of the common anti-abortion rhetoric). They know that being a commercial entity/place of public accommodation comes with rules. They can't refuse to comply with health standards or anti-competitive laws either, even though being ""forced"" to comply with those limits their bodily autonomy just as much.</quote> Health standards are legitimate because they are backed up by sound justification: you don't get to poison people. You can argue about what degree those health standards should go to, but this is my whole point: You need to justify the SPECIFIC law. Saying ""well you chose to be a baker, therefore you are willingly complying with any fucking rule I can think of"" is nonsense. If the government said ""anybody who grows or buys **ANY FOOD** has to also rape their own mother,"" it would be ludicrous to suggest that people did so willingly. That's an extreme example, which comes back to my point: the *specifics* of the law are what you need to justify, not the existence of ANY law. <quote>Because in this case, there is a causal relationship between the ""other human being"" and the minority stress/financial harm. If they hadn't refused the customer, no harm would have been done.</quote> You could say this about anything. If I don't give you $250 so you can pay the rent, I just caused you stress and financial harm, by your logic. <quote>You really believe that businesses should be legally allowed to deny service to blind passengers, or what do you mean by ""legitimate role of government""?</quote> Didn't I just say that? The government has no right to tell people they can't be jerks. <quote>To pick an even more obvious example: what about religious doctors/nurses who would prefer to refuse washing their entire forearms before a medical procedure? Should they be allowed to as well? That ""inaction"" could potentially result in death.</quote> Except that inaction is **NOT** causing the death, what's causing the death is you sticking your arm in somebody. I'm not sticking my arm in anybody when I refuse to interact with them at all. <quote>You haven't shown that yet. You're turning it into a straw man argument by translating what I say into the broadest conceivable principles, so your criticism can work.</quote> I did actually. Your justification is ""X causes indirect harm to Y, so we are banning X. The reason this is not imposing on the civil liberties of anybody who wants to do X is because they are willingly engaging in the activity in the first place."" In this hypothetical, not taking your kids to church every week results in some increased likelihood of depression, maybe lower income later in life, more stress, etc. And the reason it's not imposing on your civil liberties is because you willingly chose to have kids. IF AND ONLY IF you choose to have kids, you have to take them to church. How is this anything other than a direct usage of your rationale? You can't just assert that I'm straw manning you and then call it a day. <quote>That's what I meant by ""unless they explicitly express their endorsement"". If a baker just does his job and doesn't say anything about the decorations, how would you go about to determine whether they felt good or bad about their meaning/significance? You can't. If they don't say anything, it can neither be interpreted as a rejection, nor an endorsement. That's comes with being a professional.</quote> Wtf does this have to do with anything at all? The baker in question is making it very obvious what their opinion is. I can't fathom what point you're making here. <quote>I'm not denying that someone could feel uncomfortable by a customer's request. I was making the point that services and products like cakes are generally chosen because of their quality/suitability/price etc. Whether the provider agrees with the cause isn't usually a factor.</quote> Why are you deliberately ignoring what the baker wants? Yes, the CONSUMER can choose a baker for whatever reason they want. Things like quality or service or whatever else. What we're talking about is what the BAKER wants.

I explain why, and you ignore it. <quote>I don't see what that has to do with inequality.</quote> Ok, thanks. Do you have anything relevant to say in response to my point?

There is no unwashed arm analog in the discrimination example, because I'm not DOING anything to you at all. <quote>This has nothing to do with inequality either.</quote> So? Oh did you just declare that fixing ""inequality"" is the purview of the government above civil liberties? This is the third time you've mentioned this in this post, and I don't think you've mentioned it at all before. Is that because you realize your position doesn't actually make sense and so you're trying to shift the conversation in a different direction? <quote>OK, so far I've humored your church suggestion for the sake of argument, but I do have to object. At best such a study could show correlation. To get to causation, you'd first have to show that there isn't a third common factor that explains the statistical difference. E.g. churchgoers could be more open to community activities than the general population, or perhaps it's because believers have a stronger feeling of purpose/belonging. The alleged benefit could then be achieved by other means than going to church. Furthermore, it's conceivable that being forced to go to church against one's will would have the opposite effect.</quote> No all of this is flat out wrong. 1. It's a hypothetical scenario. Are you denying even the **possibility** of such a study linking negative affects with lack of church attendance? Really you can't even imagine that being true for the sake of argument? 2. There isn't any way to actually PROVE causality in social sciences. 3. It doesn't matter if there are other ways to achieve the same results. Are you suggesting the ONLY way to alleviate stress is to not have been discriminated against? <quote>That's the point. The baker would first have to make it obvious, before one could conclude that they are endorsing (or rejecting) the reason for a cake. Merely decorating a cake according to a customer's specification is not an endorsement of that reason.

If you're willing to sell it for Satanic rituals lead done by white people, but not to black people doing the same rituals, that difference evaporates.

The people who just walk down to city hall to get married are just as married as the people who spent $30,000 on a wedding reception. So yes, the party is entirely separate from the process of becoming legally wed. And that is why their argument--that baking a cake for a gay wedding violates their religious beliefs--is indefensible. The cake has no part in determining whether the gay couple gets married. That happens in a back room with two witnesses and a justice of the peace. They don't need a cake to sign a marriage license. So what it comes down to is the baker wants to be allowed to discriminate against two people because they are gay.</quote> Being entirely separate from the process of becoming legally wed is irrelevant. It's still a party designed to specifically celebrate their union, which makes it different from merely serving a bagel to somebody who happens to be gay. How is what you just said in any way an argument for their position being indefensible? Their position is not ""we don't want to bake a cake because our cake will allow them to be legally wed.""

Well what we're discussing is the legitimacy of the rule, so I don't think citing the rule itself is a justification for the rule to exist. Baking a cake for a gay wedding is not critical to society, so they have no inherent duty to do so. They're not freeloading on society by partaking of society's goods while not giving back.

The only hint of legitimacy their argument has is their desire to not participate in a ritual they disagree with. But the ritual they disagree with is the marriage, not the party. It's worth considering more extreme situations here to understand the absurdity of their position. What is to stop the gay couple from lying and telling the baker the wedding is over, and this is a birthday cake...but they want it to look exactly like a wedding cake?

You can object to being a part of that because it's something you can point to and it's the same for everyone. But the ceremony and reception are different for everyone. Different people and different cultures celebrate weddings differently, so there is no clear border or defining line that tells where ""celebrating a marriage"" starts and stops. It opens the door to indefinite discrimination against people who are gay, because at any given moment they may be ""celebrating their union.""</quote> No. Stop putting words in other people's mouths just because you want to win an internet argument. I'm not sure where you got the idea that literally the ONLY thing these people might oppose is the legal contract. There is literally no reason to think this and you are clearly exhibiting some ridiculous mental gymnastics. In fact, I would hazard a guess and say many christian bakers care FAR MORE about the ritual and the ceremony than the legal contract. Again, you're just making this up out of thin air. As for the gay couple lying and saying it's a birthday, they're free to do whatever they want as long as it's not hurting anybody. <quote>In a manner of speaking. We have already agreed the state has an interest in regulating business, and in ensuring equal access to businesses for everyone without regard to race, religion, sexual orientation, etc. Your job is to convince me why business should be given an exemption to discriminate against gay people; or why the earlier equal access rule should be abandoned and business should be free to discriminate against anyone for any reason. You haven't convinced me of either.</quote> Uh no we didn't agree with that. Your job is to convince me why you get to force me to interact with somebody that I don't want to interact with *for any reason.* All you're saying is the rule exists so it should exist. <quote>I'm not talking about forcing anyone to do anything. I've already said nobody is forced to become a baker, and nobody is forced to bake cakes for free. But once you enter into an agreement with the state to start a business that is open to the public, the state has an interest in ensuring your business serves the public equally. If you don't want to do that, don't open a bakery and claim that you serve the public.</quote> . <quote>That already happens. You agree to pay taxes, keep your perishable foods chilled and stored properly, pay your employees the minimum wage, etc. If you violate any of these conditions your license to operate a business can be revoked. This is no different.</quote> If you force your way into literally every commercial activity and then dictate what people can and can't do, yes you are indeed forcing people to do something. The force comes from the fact that the government won't let me operate a business in any other way. You can't heavily restrict my options and then claim my selection was voluntary. Do you realize that this entire argument implies the government can impose *whatever rule they want* on businesses because hey people can just not own a business, right? In reality, each rule should be evaluated on its merits instead of just giving the government a blank check to do whatever they want. <quote>Preventing tax dollars and the approval of the state from being used to promote discrimination is important. Protecting a free and open market is important. Let me ask you this: let's say individual businesses are free to discriminate against gay people.

Should one baker be allowed to call every other baker and warn them that a gay couple is coming around looking for cake, and then they all agree to deny service?

We protect religious freedoms in this country, so there is a scintilla of substance to their argument that they shouldn't have to participate or contribute to something that violates their faith.

You're saying the only thing people can legitimately oppose is a legal contract? LOL I can't fathom where the fuck you're getting this. People are allowed to oppose whatever behavior they want, and it doesn't have to be restricted to just legal contracts. They're allowed to oppose the ritual itself. <quote>Exactly. There is no legitimate argument for the state to sanction this behavior. This is not about protecting their religious liberties, it's about normalizing discrimination again. The state has a legitimate interest, exercised through its right to regulate the market, to ensure this does not happen.</quote> People are allowed to oppose gay marriage, meaning the ritual not the legal contract. I have no idea wtf you're talking about here. <quote>We as a society have agreed that already. Are you arguing narrowly that a baker should be allowed to refuse service for a gay wedding, or that a baker should be allowed to refuse service to gay people for any reason? If the latter, you are arguing against something that has already been decided--the state has an interest in protecting consumers from discrimination. You have a much higher hurdle to jump to convince me of that.</quote> You keep talking about whether or not you're convinced as if I care. How about you convince me where you're getting the right to force somebody to interact with somebody else? Because nothing you're saying is a justification for that. <quote>As far as ""forcing you to interact"" with someone, you're revealing that this is not just about protecting religious liberties, but about opening up a window for state-sanctioned discrimination. That's something that we, as a society, have repeatedly rejected over the years. If you allow the baker to discriminate against a gay person, why shouldn't the country club be allowed to deny Jews and blacks membership again? Why shouldn't the realtor and the banks be allowed to redline neighborhoods again?</quote> It's about both. Remember how I made two arguments in the beginning? 1. there is a difference between not serving gay people and not serving a gay wedding. Nothing you've said refutes this. 2. Aside from that, the government doesn't have the right to force somebody to interact with anybody for ANY reason. This is not ""revealing"" anything, I explicitly said it in my first post. And saying ""society has decided"" is not an argument in favor of the decision. If you're here to just say ""some people disagree with you"" then I'm not interested, because you're not telling me anything I don't know and you're not refuting anything I'm saying. Yes if a bunch of people want something, they can do it. That doesn't justify the action itself in any way. <quote>Also, the idea of interaction is tenuous at best. What if your business is online? You just take orders and ship them out. You don't really interact with your customers. Should you still be allowed to refuse to bake and deliver a cake to a person you will never actually see? What is the argument for that? This gets back to what I said earlier: you're couching this primarily as a religious freedom argument because that's the most socially acceptable way to frame it. Once you peel the layers back and realize that it's an attempt to go back to the type of broad-based discrimination we already outlawed, it becomes much harder to defend.</quote> The argument for that is that I'm allowed to do wtf I want. Your argument is ""but it's so MEAN."" I agree it's mean, I don't agree that the government has a right to stop somebody from being a jerk. I'm not couching it as anything. go back and read my posts again from the start, because I'm not changing my tone or my position at all. Here's what I said at the beginning: <quote>Why should anybody be able to tell me who I can and can't serve for any reason? I shouldn't have to give you a good or consistent reason why I want to interact with somebody. Even if it is bigotry or homophobia or whatever else, what gives you the right to force me to do something?</quote> There's no peeling back any layers, you're just not reading what I'm writing. <quote>Your decision to open a business was a choice. **Having to abide by the rules that the local, state, and federal governments have set up isn't a radical proposition. **There is always room to improve or modulate what those rules are. Let's talk about zoning codes sometime, especially parking minimums. Those are a heavy burden on business. But having to serve every customer equally is not a burden on anyone. The regulation has plenty of benefits and no negatives.</quote> Ok the bolded part is a perfect example of your problem in this discussion. What makes it ""radical"" is entirely dependent on what the rule is. Some rules are radical, some aren't. I'm not saying the government has no right to create ANY legislation, I'm saying there are SOME they have no right to create. I'm saying the legitimacy of the government's actions is dependent on the action in question, but you (and other people) just keep repeating platitudes about how the government has the right to regulate. <quote>I'm not about giving blank checks. But I'm also not arguing that the government has zero authority to regulate business. Clearly they do. That's what precedent does. If we accept that the government can regulate business for health and safety reasons, why not for social reasons? I agree, let's evaluate each policy on its merits. As I said earlier, protecting against discrimination does not place an undue burden on business, while ensuring greater opportunity and a freer market for everyone.</quote> NOBODY said the government has zero authority to regulate business. As for why safety rather than social, because safety infringes on people's rights (again, depending on the specific law), and social reasons don't.

They still wanted the optics of the Hispanic on screen but they wanted the actress who could best bring the character to life. That's equal opportunity and the OPPOSITE of racism.

Basically, if you want to use the words in such a manner as an attempt to shame others, you are going to have to come up with new words which actually indicate these original positions which should be shamed because the loaded words of the past no longer have the same weight to them...

The female lead wasnt believable in a handful of ways. How did she know how to fight well enough with a light saber to fight a sithe lord the first time she ever used a light saber? How did she know how to use force powers without any training? It just breaks from tradition and gets very hokey. It's just an unbelievable and relatable character. She is just the best in the world at everything, even the first time she tries. I wouldn't have a problem with her becoming the most powerful Jedi ever but not just out of no where.

You mean praise in the ""gender studies"" sense, not praise in the ""movie studies"" sense. I suppose some people might be interested to pay money to see a movie that they don't find entertaining if it satiates some ideological belief system, in the same way that religious people might go to see a poorly done religious movie because it portrays the message they want. But that's a limited audience, and at least it's honestly advertised as a preachy religious movie. If WW is just that for gender studies, then it should be honest about that. I haven't seen WW yet, but it's been my understanding that the movie itself was good. Now I'm a bit worried. Edit: Incidentally, wouldn't Terminator 2 be a much better ""feminist"" film if what you are saying is true? Linda Hamilton kicked ass as the lead. Arnold Schwarzenegger's masculinity wasn't affected by Hamilton, and Arnold was even portrayed in an oddly sensitive way as learning from her son, part child, part man, part machine.

You say you think it's nice to see more female led and directed films, and I believe you're sincere. On an intellectually level you get that there's a problem with women in film and in culture, but emotionally you haven't fully internalised the extent of it. The very fact that you're having to reach for two films decades apart to make this gender based point - and that doesn't ring any alarm bells in your head - says so, so much. It can be very hard for straight white guys to get this, but I can try an analogy. I want you to imagine a world where the Terminator, Indiana Jones, The Good the Bad and the Ugly, Schindler's List, The Shining, Lord of the Rings, 12 Angry Men, Bill and Ted, Do The Right Thing, Chinatown, Fight Club, Vertigo, Pulp Fiction, the Harry Potter films, Top Gun, Toy Story, The Big Lebowski, Back to the Future, Blade Runner, The Social Network, Citizen Kane, Monty Python's Holy Grail, Shaun of the Dead, The Ring, Akira, Groundhog Day, Brazil, Office Space, and many many more did not exist. A world without Steven Spielberg, Akira Kurosawa, Spike Lee, Woody Allen, David Fincher, Francis Ford Coppola, Werner Herzog, Quentin Tarantino... I mean they'd be alive, but they wouldn't have gone into film. Can you imagine a world like this? The colossal cultural gap? How different would the world be? I imagine at least a few hardcore film buffs would genuinely rather die than live in this world. Except actually, we are living in this world right now. An entire gender has been systematically blocked from film, and we never saw their contributions. They had just as much to give, but they never got the chance. In our oppression of women, we will never know the full extent of what we have lost, but I can assure you it was equivalent to the above. That being said, I do like to imagine that there's an alternate universe with a female Charlie Chaplin, a female Kubrick, a female Walt Disney. Where a female directed majority female staffed Godfather starring a woman changed film forever. Where a female directed Star Wars starring a woman left a permanent mark on Hollywood sci-fi an still had legions of fans. Where you, the male, would have to beg for cultural crumbs. Do you like American Psycho and Lost in Translation? You damn well better, because they're all you have. These are the only male led films of any major cultural and critical significance in all history (both, coincidentally, directed by women). Where men were so Othered that women would actually explain to you with a straight face that the Goblin King in Labyrinth was one of the strongest male characters in all film, and they'd sincerely mean it ('it even has a male director! So progressive!'), and they'd get confused and defensive when you told them in your nicest voice that while Goblin King has a special place in your heart as a strong male character, you don't feel the same way. And then Batman vs. Superman comes out and it blows your mind. You've never seen your gender like this before on screen. Only women get to be superheroes. And then some woman comes a long and says 'it's not as good as American Psycho or Lost in Translation, so I don't understand why you like it'. You are that woman. Does this help? **A second point**, you consider Kill Bill and Alien to be adequately feminist, but that WW was too preachy. I'm sorry, there's no way of wording this without it sounding like criticism - is the film really too preachy, or is it you? Like when someone says 'no thanks I'm a vegetarian' and we get all defensive because we think 'are they judging me' and we're worried that they're right and we're morally wrong, and we get all angry and feel preached to when all the person actually said was 'no thanks I'm a vegetarian'. Kill Bill and Alien, both films directed by men with male sensibilities, both are powerful in masculine ways (men typically do not admire feminine strength), with lingering shots of the actresses bodies and pandering to the straight male gaze, this feminism doesn't challenge you. But a female directed film with female sensibilities, where the camera doesn't linger over her body, with significant female presence beyond just the protagonists, who is physically strong but in a distinctly feminine way - you think of yourself as a good feminist liberal person, but this feels *too* feminist for you. But that clashes with your view of yourself as a good person and you project your own bad judgement of yourself onto the film. Are you sure the film hasn't merely said 'hey here's a female superhero doing cool stuff' and through your own mental baggage you've reached 'THE FILM IS PREACHING TO ME'.",4298,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,"[4355, 4298]","allupinthisjoint, please remember to keep the discussion civil and respectful.

I think it's safe to assume almost everyone will agree that by defining racism as ""prejudice, discrimination, or antagonism directed against someone of a different race based on the belief that one's own race is superior"" means anyone can be racist.</quote> This paragraph is strange to me because you're basically saying, ""the definition you're using for racism is wrong because if we agree to define racism differently then it means something else!"" I think you're missing an important part of the ""prejudice + power"" position. They're *not* saying that prejudice is okay or should be tolerated by anyone. What the academics who proposed this new shift in understanding are trying to do is decouple racism from prejudice alone. Look at your own definition for racism, do you see any problems with it? Because I see one huge one, ""...based on the belief that one's own race is superior"" means that nothing is racist *unless they have this specific belief*. And since beliefs are in the mind and we're not mind readers, it makes calling racism out a very difficult task. This is where you get people defending their racist notions because of their black friends, or taking a neutral to positive approach to their prejudice (like ""Asian people are good at math""). In short, it provides a cop out for people when they do something others might consider racist. So the idea here was to shift how society looks at racism verses prejudice. Racism, in this context, addresses the systemic and institutional problems faced by minorities rather than trying to paint individuals as racist. There's a growing movement among anti-racists that maybe we need to stop describing people as racist all together, and tie it more to actions or behaviors. ""Tod, what you said was racist."" might foster better discussion than, ""Tod, you're a racist."" There's a lot to discuss about this, but we really should try coming to the table with more understanding of the other positions here. Calling the people who say that ""racism = power + prejudice"" unintelligent isn't really doing that. They're coming from a different place than you. <quote> The 'prejudice + power' argument DOES NOT mean that minorities can not be racist against white people. This would only make sense if every white person had power over every minority. But power does not come from race alone. A black person born into a wealthy family that is well connected, went to a great school, went to a top university with his parents paying all his tuition, has more power than a white person who was born into poverty, grew up in a trailer, coudn't afford to go to a decent school yet alone college. The point is, power comes from many sources, race is only one.</quote> Again, the idea is to highlight the effects these power imbalances have on groups as a whole. This notion is often corrupted by people who want to push an agenda, but don't let them get in the way of good conversation. If someone tells you that a black person can't be racist then just ignore them. No single person is the arbiter of how words work in the English language. Nobody died and made them king of racism. <quote> What if a black teacher intentionally discriminates against his/her white students?

You have to understand the *context* in which this definition is used. It's used largely in sociology and anthropology courses, and it's used to describe societies, not people. It's a useful definition in this context because prejudice in the direction of societal power looks and operates very different than in the other direction. Let's look at a more extreme example, the US 200 years ago, in the middle of slavery. Prejudice most likely existed in both directions. I'm sure the black slaves had some very strong opinions about white people in general that were largely inaccurate and very generalizing. I'm sure if they met a random white person on the street, they would have some very strong racial prejudice about the person. They might even have some negative feelings and thoughts about the person. However, the black people from 200 years ago had no power whatsoever to affect society at large, to influence thoughts and minds. The damage their prejudice was capable of was essentially 0. However, the white slavemasters who had prejudice had much more influence. Beyond just the fact they owned slaves, discussions white people had amongst themselves, and the prejudice they discussed, could have severe impact on black people. How they were treated, abuse, being sold, etc. And we aren't just talking about one type of power. Many black people were stronger than white people, they could totally physically overpower them. There were black slaves who looked after white children who had some level of power and authority over them in the day to day. However, the white kids still would have power over them just from their skin tone. It's more subtle in today's environment, but the overall concept remains largely the same. As a whole, in our society, white people still have more influence over the lives of black people than the other way around. Government policy, which is primarily formed by white men, has major and far reaching influence over black people and black communities, and those communities in many ways lack a voice. If you zoom in very closely, yes there are black people in positions of power over white people. However, looking at society as a whole this isn't the case overall. Racism, using THIS definition, refers to society as a whole, not individual people. So remember, this is a sociological term. So in American society, black people as a whole lack power, which means that it's only the white prejudice that manifests as racism.",4430,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[4538, 4430]","Hi joalr0, thank you for sharing your perspective on the concept of ""racism = power + prejudice.""

5089,dkcs7pt,6ntko9,1500331468,Waphlez,"<quote> Why do you think morality is subjective?</quote> Refer to my earlier post regarding rationalism. Whether or not objective morality exists or not, there does not seem a way to prove it or disprove it, which is important when forming an argument. Almost all proofs/arguments for objective morality rely on axiomatic foundations that themselves aren't objective. In fact the entire concept of objective truth is still a philosophical conversion going to this day. The best we can do is try and argue our case and see if others follow your logic <quote> I disagree. I think it's objectively true to say that you shouldn't be morally against LGBT folks.</quote> And they can just as easily say they are objectively right. Moral objectivity is this wall people put up in moral arguments that shuts down conversion and compromise. <quote> What premise?</quote> I won't go further besides what I'm about to type because it's irrelevant to the CMV and it's a complicated conversation to begin with, but I'll leave you with this. I think veganism does two things wrong. One it attempts to qualify animals the same rights we expect humans give to ourselves. Two, that suffering has objective negative moral worth. I believe these are a combination of emotional arguments (i.e. ""it just feels wrong"") and the axiom that all suffering is wrong. I reject the emotional argument, and I am neutral on the concern of suffering (see below). I believe human rights are entirely created by us via social contract. The logic of doing to others what you'd want done to yourself is self-serving and the most logical thing for a person to do. The only way to ensure nobody else breaks the contract is for everyone, including yourself, to honor the social contract. Anyone can reject all or parts of the social contract, with the understanding that it goes the other way as well (the rights they would have been granted from the social contract are revoked). Therefore this creates a flexible moral system that maximizes personal liberty. Animals, due to their lack of sapience, are incapable of joining and reciprocating the rights granted by the social contract, and therefore do not have the rights we grant other people. The attribute of pain is a biological mechanism to provide negative stimuli, selected by evolution to prolong life expectancy. Pain/suffering itself has no moral worth (positive or negative), and in my opinion requires an arbitrary axiom to say so. Empathy is also a biological mechanism selected by evolution. Given my premise that the golden rule is the most logical way for humans to live with each other, it made sense that empathy evolved with us, but the feeling of empathy itself has no moral worth. That's already way too much conversation than I felt like writing, so I'm going to leave it at this.

Animals do not have agency because they are not capable of rationalizing agency, just like anything without meta-conscious impulse lacks agency. Comparing eating an animal to killing a human is such a false-equivalency it's amazing. 1. Coercion is a pre-action impulse. Stopping a murder by talking somebody out of it isn't coercion, threatening and harassing them into murdering another person IS coercion. Not-murdering is the base state, you can't coerce somebody to be the base state of what it is to be human, you can only coerce somebody into being an aberration from the base state of what they (as an individual or as a human being) normally are. 2. Stopping a murder isn't depriving the murder of agency, it is protecting the agency of another person. There is a difference between taking agency from another person and preserving agency of somebody who is having theirs taken away. 3. Animals don't have agency. Let's take your murderer example: Is it wrong to stop an animal from killing another animal? After all, if you assume that they both have agency then it's ethically incorrect to allow an animal to kill another.

It's being able to achieve goals. If I gave a poor person the following 2 scenarios, which would they pick? **Scenario 1:** - You get no money. - Your children will have college paid for. - You get a retirement home. - You never have to work more than 30 hours per week. - You get six weeks of vacation, all expenses paid per year. - Etc. **Scenario 2:** - You get a million dollars. - You have to stay at your current shitty job working 60 hours a week. - Your kids aren't allowed to go to university. - Etc.

It's not an intelligent argument to take two things with countless differences, pick one of those differences and arbitrarily attribute that as the cause for the different outcome. You're not controlling for any variables, so you can't confidently claim that the one you're looking at is the cause rather than some other variables. With the small sample size of countries that we have to look at and the lack of any country that's just like the US except with different healthcare policy, you can't even begin to properly control for variables. That's why arguing by comparison is an inevitably poor method here. There are so many different legal, cultural, economic, historic and demographic elements of context that are different and will contribute systemically directly and indirectly to healthcare costs. So, since that's an inevitably poor argument, you have to resort to other ways to argue why healthcare costs are what they are or why healthcare policy should be a certain way. Even to the extent that you do use comparisons it's not clear how to fit them to the federal system. If European countries each have their own system and the EU doesn't run it, then I'd say that's a closer parallel to healthcare implemented at the state, not federal level. If all European countries happily surrendered their healthcare systems to have it run by the EU, that's a closer parallel to the US federal government managing it.

For the reasons I mentioned above, comparing countries does not come close to proving the claim true, therefore there isn't yet any reason to entertain the idea. My ability to provide specific reasons why things differ from country to country is limited because I don't know about each country's corporate law, culture, geography, patent law, regulatory policy, etc. enough to know what the exhaustive list of points of difference between the US and that country are, which will vary for each country. That's sort of the point. There are too many variables to make it productive to focus on why we are different from other countries. Instead, we should just be focusing on what in our country increases the cost of healthcare. Some of those things (e.g. redundant bureaucracy in insurance processing, burden on employers to fund insurance as a benefit) seems related to whether we have single payer and many (e.g. patent and orphan drug act abuse by pharmaceutical companies, FDA and other regulatory policies, obesity and health trends of the population as a whole) are not directly related to whether we have medicare for all. I'm not here to say which it is. I'm just saying that the argument by comparison of national performance is objectively poor.

The testament are believed by the church to be the statements of witnesses, heck that's why it's called a testament. Your statement ""We don't have witnesses, we have stories, since the witnesses are long gone and possibly fabricated."" can be said about any past event prior to the invention of video recording equipment. How do we know what happened during the Thirty Year's War? From accounts written about it during and after that time, but those who were around to experience it. even worse, prior to the printing press, when all manuscripts were hand copied errors could occur even between the authors ""original"" and the person they hired to produce the first 1000 copies, never mind the millennium and a half of continuous recopying. Throw into the mix translations between languages and were standing in a very muddy pond. So how do we check our witnesses? We check them against other witnesses So for our Thirty Years' war account we find another account by a different person, when we can. The bible is no different, certainly there are historical accounts within the bible that can be checked against other historical sources. And while to use the Bible seems like a single source but it is made up of multiple books written by different individuals that were then selected together to form a corpus. The gospels (Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John) are each accounts that can be checked against each other, and biblical scholars do this and they have found that these gospels have some common source material (called M and Q) but are not wholly in agreement. Certainly based on analysis of the gospels that are canon, compared to others written that didn't make the cut, the gospels we have in the bible are the oldest surviving documents of their type, and are closest chronologically to the events they relate to us. But it is taking a witness at their word, just like in a court case, ultimately do I believe in what the little old lady with poor vision saw at night as the correct version of the crime that took place? If you already believe in a god, i.e. if you have taken the original leap of faith then the testimony of witnesses that say they saw the supernatural events that god caused would be evidence for you. For juror number 6 though who doesn't believe in god, then he might not believe out little old lady either. <quote> Even so, black holes are not considered to be a certainty, whereas faith is, and should be interpreted as such.</quote> I wont argue that Christian teaching presents itself as the ""universal truth,"" but it relies on the belief of an individual and their confidence in that belief. We have faith in our understanding of the world because of out confidence in the Scientific method. We have faith in it because it has thus far shown to be an accurate predictor of observable phenomena. <quote> The fact we can't absolutely prove they exist doesn't mean they don't have evidence.</quote> This is not really any different that the statement I made about about proving with certainty that god does or doesn't exists. just because there is no direct Evidence for god, doesn't mean that god doesn't have observable effect that can't be measured as indirect or circumstantial evidence. For you the method for acquiring evidence for the systems of the universe might be the scientific method, while for a religiously faithful person might use theological and philosophical methods combined with their own empirical observations to acquire the body of evidence for their own beliefs. To use the court of law analogy, you might assign more weight to the statement of a forensics expert, some smudgy fingerprints, and a grainy security cam feed. While our ""true believer"" might put more weight to the statement of the store clerk, the arresting officer, and that same security video. <quote> If you look back at history, our evolution has been very much a process of getting approximately right answers, and then refining them. Whereas religion has not progressed at all since then.</quote> Progress is not a metric for correctness, and assuming that the religious thought hasn't progressed just because the core statements of faith haven't changed is just as flawed an assumption. <quote> Nope. You're a few centuries too late for that one. Descartes was one of the main dudes who actually asked this question, and his answer was that our senses don't lie because we can independently verify them with other sense, or through the perception of others, reaching a consensus. Of course, there is no way to know 100% what is going on, but that's not reason enough to believe there are implausible things happening.</quote> My analogy of the senses is solipsistic, to be sure, but as your last line betrays ""Of course, there is no way to know 100% what is going on."" I'll fully admit that that lack of certainty is where religion thrives, but that's kinda the point right? to provide a sense of certainty in a world were so much can me uncertain? <quote> Just because someone can explain it better, doesn't mean that faith is based on anything more than assumptions, which have received a total of zero new evidence in the past thousand years, especially considering that the past century alone has brought exponential advances in most fields.</quote> the point I was making is that questions about god, or the soul, or the nature of existence has exercised some of the greatest human minds. That for religion or philosophy there are many people way smarter and more educated on the subject that I could even pretend to be, especially as this is far outside my own field of study or interest. If you really want your view changed look at the works of those who have put the time in and spend years or decades on the subject, They I'm certain will be better able to be the ""lawyer"" for their case that I can. There are many fields of study where the scientific method doesn't work; all of the humanities, history culture, the arts, etc. The methods for studying history haven't really changed in hundreds of years, it is still a field of textual and literary analysis and interpretation. Like I said above progress isn't a metric for correctness. Is Daft Punk superior to Beethoven, because of synthesized music? the tools have changed, but the principles of music haven't. In the end I can't convince you of something you aren't willing to believe, and like i said originally, I'm not sure i want to convince you or anyone. The OP stated that there is no evidence for the supernatural, and by the scientific method there isn't. My post was offering a alternative view, and that the means for gathering evidence and what evidence is considered valid may differ for a religious person. Maybe, to paraphrase hamlet, there are many more things in heaven and earth that dreamt of in our philosophy. Putting your views out on this sub and daring other to change them especially on Reddit which has a pretty healthy STEM bias, is a bit of a circlejerk. I'm happy to claim my agnosticism. As a twenty-something guy who doesn't even have his own life figured out, pretending that I know anything about the universe is pretty damn arrogant, especially when I am such a tiny and insignificant part of it.

Certainly based on analysis of the gospels that are canon, compared to others written that didn't make the cut, the gospels we have in the bible are the oldest surviving documents of their type, and are closest chronologically to the events they relate to us. But it is taking a witness at their word, just like in a court case, ultimately do I believe in what the little old lady with poor vision saw at night as the correct version of the crime that took place? If you already believe in a god, i.e. if you have taken the original leap of faith then the testimony of witnesses that say they saw the supernatural events that god caused would be evidence for you. For juror number 6 though who doesn't believe in god, then he might not believe out little old lady either.</quote> That's mighty convenient for the church, but a witness statement is just a transcript of what someone would say orally in a trial. Since they're dead, it's hearsay, since the bible isn't even signed by them. I'm not saying that I'd believe them anyway, just that it doesn't constitute as witnesses. And your entire reasoning can only be used to prove that other books might be wrong, not that this book is right, especially since most books have been updated since then. <quote> I wont argue that Christian teaching presents itself as the ""universal truth,"" but it relies on the belief of an individual and their confidence in that belief. We have faith in our understanding of the world because of out confidence in the Scientific method. We have faith in it because it has thus far shown to be an accurate predictor of observable phenomena.</quote> Well, my point exactly, it relies on the notion that you must believe what it says, which is very much against the scientific method. Especially for content that's so outdated. The scientific method does not work due to ""confidence"" or ""faith"", but rather because it has observable consequences that build up into arguments that are the basis for other arguments, thus verifying the whole system. If it were faith someone would just tell you what to believe, and would call you a heretic if you want to improve their theorem. Einstein would be burned on a stake if science were like religion, since he basically reinvented the whole approach. <quote> This is not really any different that the statement I made about about proving with certainty that god does or doesn't exists. just because there is no direct Evidence for god, doesn't mean that god doesn't have observable effect that can't be measured as indirect or circumstantial evidence. For you the method for acquiring evidence for the systems of the universe might be the scientific method, while for a religiously faithful person might use theological and philosophical methods combined with their own empirical observations to acquire the body of evidence for their own beliefs. To use the court of law analogy, you might assign more weight to the statement of a forensics expert, some smudgy fingerprints, and a grainy security cam feed. While our ""true believer"" might put more weight to the statement of the store clerk, the arresting officer, and that same security video.</quote> The difference might be subtle, but it's simple: we have some evidence, whereas the religions have none. <quote> Progress is not a metric for correctness, and assuming that the religious thought hasn't progressed just because the core statements of faith haven't changed is just as flawed an assumption.</quote> I'm not seeing an argument here, just an opinion. If a branch of science doesn't get more detailed while all the others do, it's quite probable there's something wrong with it. <quote> My analogy of the senses is solipsistic, to be sure, but as your last line betrays ""Of course, there is no way to know 100% what is going on."" I'll fully admit that that lack of certainty is where religion thrives, but that's kinda the point right? to provide a sense of certainty in a world were so much can me uncertain?</quote> I believe in uncertainty, even perhaps in misticism, but I 100% do not believe in the humorous specificity of religion. So we should believe we don't know many things, but these religious things we just happen to 100% know in super clarity? Yeah, no. <quote> the point I was making is that questions about god, or the soul, or the nature of existence has exercised some of the greatest human minds. That for religion or philosophy there are many people way smarter and more educated on the subject that I could even pretend to be, especially as this is far outside my own field of study or interest. If you really want your view changed look at the works of those who have put the time in and spend years or decades on the subject, They I'm certain will be better able to be the ""lawyer"" for their case that I can. There are many fields of study where the scientific method doesn't work; all of the humanities, history culture, the arts, etc. The methods for studying history haven't really changed in hundreds of years, it is still a field of textual and literary analysis and interpretation. Like I said above progress isn't a metric for correctness. Is Daft Punk superior to Beethoven, because of synthesized music? the tools have changed, but the principles of music haven't.</quote> Again, if that were true, that very smart people understand these things, religion would have evolved just like all the other sciences. While it's difficult to ""compare"" art, the tools used by Daft Punk are significantly better than those used by Beethoven. Similarly, their understanding of how the fundamentals can be used is also much more detailed and the complexity of the work is also significantly improved. Or, to put it differently, Beethoven would make much more interesting music nowadays. <quote> In the end I can't convince you of something you aren't willing to believe, and like i said originally, I'm not sure i want to convince you or anyone. The OP stated that there is no evidence for the supernatural, and by the scientific method there isn't. My post was offering a alternative view, and that the means for gathering evidence and what evidence is considered valid may differ for a religious person. Maybe, to paraphrase hamlet, there are many more things in heaven and earth that dreamt of in our philosophy. Putting your views out on this sub and daring other to change them especially on Reddit which has a pretty healthy STEM bias, is a bit of a circlejerk. I'm happy to claim my agnosticism. As a twenty-something guy who doesn't even have his own life figured out, pretending that I know anything about the universe is pretty damn arrogant, especially when I am such a tiny and insignificant part of it. So ultimately, I don't know the truth of the universe, but are you confident that you DO? shrugs</quote> That's like saying I can't convince you if you don't want to just believe me, which is illogical.

But, it's easy to believe when your experiences are consistent with evidence from other sources from reliable sources. What this sounds like is that you are arguing from personal incredulity. You don't believe it, and it doesn't square with your experiences and the reliable sources that you trust, so it's not valid and those that suggest it might be accurate are unreasonable. Only, that's a not a statement about external reality. But, I think we've drifted a bit. People don't claim unicorns. They don't see unicorns. They don't experience unicorns. All unicorn information is secondary information. But, that's not what happens when people discuss religion. Many (most?) religious individuals have a first-hand experience that corroborates. Many people who are raised religious don't stay religious because they don't have any experiences. Others are not raised in a religious environment but have an experience that results in a religious conversion. You can disagree. You can disbelieve. But, your opinion of their experience doesn't change their experience. Any more or less than the fact that I might think that experiences obtained through the use of drugs are nothing more than the random misfiring of a malfunctioning brain, and are utterly devoid of meaning or truth, makes your experiences an unreasonable basis of your beliefs. Think about it. Psychoactive drugs don't reveal truth. They merely upend your brain's natural biochemistry and scramble the processes that govern how your brain works, rather than resulting in a deeper truth it just throws a ton of static at you that you then later use to build patterns that aren't really there. Why is that a reasonable basis for belief, but someone else's brain that's operating as intended in a way that agrees with untold thousands or millions of other people's brains that are also working as intended... no, that's something that can be dismissed because you don't agree with the conclusions. Or, maybe, everyone's interpretations of these experiences are reasonable. Maybe we don't have any empirical evidence at all to support any position, even the one that the observable is all that is.

Estrogen is given via a pill but testosterone is usually given via shots or a gel. But testosterone still does not remove the breast tissue and binding for a long period of time comes with health risks, so top surgery is the better option. Transitioning (socially - coming out, new name, new pronouns etc -, through hormone replacement therapy - estrogen or testosterone respectively-, or with one or more surgeries) is known as the best treatment to erase the side effects of gender dysphoria such as depression or self harming behaviour. Locking trans people up in wards didn‘t work. Electroshock therapy didn‘t work. Conversion therapy didn‘t work. Transitioning - in which way and form someone transitions is up to them - has been showing the best results long term. It‘s well known that LGBT youth in general has way less mental health problems if they are supported by their family and friends and are allowed to live life as themselves. There is no pill to change a gender identity. Transgender people don‘t change their gender identity. They have a gender identity that doesn‘t match their bodies/assigned gender. Imagine you (I‘m assuming you‘re male, based on reddit‘s statistics) would be forced to shave all of your body hair and forced into a dress, being called „her“ and „she“ and „Jane“, and people would expect you to call yourself a woman. Would you like that? I assume not. Why? Because your gender identity, which is unchangeable, goes against that. Gender identity is found in kids as young as two or three years old. It‘s fixed before birth and trans people just ended up with one that doesn‘t match their bodies/assigned gender. [David Reimer](en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Reimer) is the most well-known and one of the saddest examples for what gender identity is.

I always come away thinking, *that made absolutely no sense*. But I understand where it comes from. During the times of slavery, the use of the word niggar *AND* nigga was heard from slave masters and overseers and was the insult of insults. It became common for slaves to refer to each other the same way, *in anger*. This was especially true for slaves who lived in the house and enjoyed a better style of living (better food, clothes, lodging, etc.). These slaves were rewarded for showing cruelty to other slaves, referring to them as niggas and treating them as such was a big part of it. It was a form of self-hatred that continued even after the abolishment of slavery; and if an argument broke out between blacks you would hear the word nigga thrown around in all directions. It continues even to this day and has become ubiquitous in regular speech for some people. Remember, this represents hundreds of years of conditioning. Have you ever wondered why other ethnic groups don't openly address each other with racial slurs? How often do you hear Jews call each other kikes, or Italians call each other wops, or Latinos call each other wet backs or Arabs call each other sand niggars or rag heads? Perhaps it’s because these groups did not spend hundreds of years enslaved by people who openly used these terms and encouraged and even *rewarded* those who used it against each other. These groups were not conditioned with this level of self-hate. So, maybe instead of insisting on being allowed to imitate this schizophrenic behavior you should instead press your friends to justify the use of the term using *logic* instead of inconsistent and contradictory emotions.

(Regarding the effectiveness of resource denial, many repressive regimes are willing to sacrifice just about anything in order to assume control of a region) As repressive regimes, in Syria for example, have demonstrated in the modern world, the existence of an armed populace does not prevent leaders from attempting to impose tyranny.

I have not set out to argue that 'guns are bad', 'gun owners are bad', or 'gun control is the only option'. Rather, I have been attempting to foster a discussion on points OP *did not mention*. Our own discussion, however, has gone far off track; I now find myself debating the validity of various arguments for and against gun control, while simultaneously fending off increasingly ... charged ... critiques. For example: <quote>And now you act as if one must be within one of these ""camps"" in order to actually have standing to argue?</quote> That is a complete misreading of my statement I am in fact, criticising both camps and some of their arguments. Membership in either camp is neither required, nor necessary. The critiques of both camps and their arguments are valid regardless of your membership or non-membership among them. The binary nature of the political positioning on this issue is a further part of the problem. &amp;nbsp; Further on, you state: <quote>... All are symptomatic of the same slippery slope, and we fundamentally don't trust you not to drag us down said slope.</quote> Not only are slippery slope arguments a common type of logical fallacy, but you have assumed my membership in a political party **without knowing in which country I live, let alone the party to which I belong.** To be blunt, I have never belonged to the Democratic party, nor have I ever voted for a Democratic candidate. &amp;nbsp; Moving on: <quote>Then why even bring it up? If it's not some it's not some major sticking point, then why the fuck does it matter?</quote> Given the amount of animosity, anger, and rhetoric surrounding this issue, an approach that does not rely on claiming 'you're wrong and here's why' would benefit everyone. I was expressing the hope that within the evangelical Christian segment of Second Amendment supporters, this discussion could approach the topic of violence, gun-ownership and gun-control from a completely different angle. Given the significant influence of Christian leaders on conservative political thought, within certain communities, this approach *might* offer a chance to discuss a challenging, emotional issue. One could easily design and implement structurally similar approaches targeting segments of the gun-control faction(s) on the left-wing who share other common features. &amp;nbsp; I agree, I would do better to chose my words more carefully. But in this case: <quote>Confront and challenge gun culture within the Christian-right.</quote> My initial statement on this issue called for self-examination within the Christian right. Not all elements of the political right within the United States are Christian; my statement specifically targeted one segment of a wider political grouping. See above for the rational. &amp;nbsp; Further discussion of insurgency is likely fruitless. Ultimately, it boils down to whether or not a hypothetical, tyrannical US government would be willing and able to bear the costs of a scorched-earth campaign to suppress insurrection. In my view, it would; in your view, it wouldn't. All I maintain is that *having this discussion* is beneficial within the context of re-examining the value, applicability and benefits of the political viewpoint that gave rise to the Second Amendment. Indeed, my own view on the subject is that another more effective form of deterrent might well be necessary due the decreased value I see in the deterrent of an armed populace. &amp;nbsp; Finally, I am not trying to change your mind regarding gun ownership.

7062,do1wd0v,74v8zr,1507415297,DoodleVnTaintschtain,"With respect to how you addressed the ""defining frivolous"" bit, I'm guessing you're not an attorney and haven't spent any real time actually looking at the cases here. If you could give me a few examples of lawsuits you'd consider frivolous, I'd be all about discussing individual examples. The way you're approaching dealing with this seems like every case that lost on summary judgment would be frivolous... I just don't think that's the case. <quote>1) It reimburses people after the case. The lawyer tax I'm proposing would give the poorer side extra money during the case, allowing them to spend it on getting better representation. Lawyers who take cases on contingency reduce the need for this wealth redistribution, but I think a lawyer tax would be more effective.</quote> All this does though is drive up the cost of legal representation for everyone. These things should be on the merit, not just based on what someone's lawyer charges. All this would do is drive the cost up more, tie up more resources in the courts, and lead to less equitable outcomes. The ""rich"" side isn't holier than the ""poor"" side. They're not automatically wrong and fucking with poor people because they can. Shifting fees works just fine, in my mind, and does more to discourage people brining shit lawsuits as a tactic. Your method would encourage lawyers to take any case on the poor guy's side, regardless of merit, because they'd be able to get paid through the lawyer tax. It should be about the merit. If you have fee shifting in the appropriate cases, and the poor guy's side has real merit, they'll get representation. If it doesn't, then they're sort of SOL, and I'm okay with that. <quote>2) As I understand it, fee-shifting isn't typically automatic: the judge needs to rule that the losing side must reimburse the winning side's legal fees. A lawyer tax would apply to every case, so a lawyer doesn't need to worry whether the judge will decide to apply fee shifting in this case.</quote> It depends on the context, honestly. Many civil rights actions get automatic fee shifting to the successful plaintiff. Plus, we're only talking about fee shifting because I gave its expansion as an alternative to an automatic tax, so talking about how it is currently isn't really relevant. Plus, there are obviously instances where it would be inappropriate to fully shift all of the fees, or to shift them at all. It would depend on the merits of the case at hand... Which is what I keep coming back to. A one-size-fits-all solution is rarely the correct one. Discretion is important. <quote>3) Fee-shifting favours the winning side, while a lawyer tax favours the poor.</quote> I don't think it's inherently good to *favor* the poor. Courts are supposed to be equal, not play favorites. Understanding that poor folk are definitely at a disadvantage in litigation (and in how the laws are written, especially in things like landlord tenant law), something needs to be done. What that is, however, shouldn't favor one side over the other. It should focus on the court's discretion and the merits of the case... Not just on who has less money. Again, because not only is that inherently biased, it just makes litigation more expensive and, perversely, more attractive. <quote>4) Lawers for rich people don't have to worry they'll lose and not get paid. They'll get paid no matter what. Only lawyers (for poor people) working on contingency have to worry about this. This isn't fair. It creates an environment where rich people can bring marginal cases to court, but poor people can't, since lawyers working on contingency won't take these cases. Maybe these marginal cases shouldn't be brought to court at all—but then no one should be able to bring them to court, including the rich.</quote> You're sort of arguing against yourself here. You're saying that bringing marginal cases is a good thing, and yet arguing that we should punish people for bringing them by expanding the definition of ""frivolous"".

Your attorney may have several days' worth of work in setting up the chain that gets the judge to dismiss it immediately.</quote> To clarify and summarize, there are solid reasons it would be very unwise to sue me for bad breath, even if I have to pay a lawyer tax: 1) There would be a minimum amount you're forced to invest into the case. So you could not use the lawyer taxes I pay to sue me for free. Just as in the current system, it would be dumb to pay for a case you know you're going to lose. 2) The judge would fine you for filing a frivolous lawsuit, with the proceeds of the fine going to me. This would more than cover my legal fees. So your lawsuit gives *me* free money, not you. 3) You don't get to pocket the funds you get from the lawyer tax: they're earmarked solely for your legal fees. So even if the judge doesn't deem your case frivolous, there's no possibility for you to make money without winning. 4) If you represent yourself in court, you can't ""pay"" yourself with the lawyer taxes I pay. Again, it's impossible for you to make money without winning. <quote> The justice system, to be fair and open, must be accessible to all for any reason.</quote> And right now it's not. Poor people do not have the same access to the legal system as rich people do. A lawyer tax would be a step towards lowering this inequality. <quote> The judges' job is literally to be a judge. Your system would place additional burden by creating a judge-before-the-judge</quote> Are you referring to deeming whether a case is frivolous? No, you're mistaken. The judge would simply deem whether a case is frivolous when he make his normal verdict. The same way that, in some kinds of cases in the current system, a judge can choose to apply fee shifting, letting the winning side recover their legal fees from the losing side. <quote> that attorney getting 30% of your $50,000 expenses doesn't suddenly make their lawyer better.</quote> The lawyer tax doesn't make any attorney better. But it does allow the attorney for the poorer side to spend more time on the case, making their work better and more thorough. <quote> And the expenses only come after the work's begun. Lawyers can't just say, ""This case is going to cost $XX"" because there is so much research, changing facts and stories, etc., as the case goes on. It's literally impractical enough that it couldn't be made to work.</quote> Let's walk through this. Each side begins by paying their lawyers the minimum mandated by the law to kick off the case. The lawyers log their hours in an app, with the data available to everyone involved in the case. This allows us to recalculate lawyer taxes every day. There is no delay. Each side is always up to date on how much lawyer taxes they and their opponents owe. Being unable to predict how much a case will cost matters no more than it does in the current legal system. In fact, it matters less. Because if one side goes broke partway through the case, they can fund the rest of the case with the lawyer tax. They'll have significantly less money to pay their lawyer, but they'll still have some. <quote> Extra tax burden on the poor, who can't afford it, simply for being sued, something they can't control.</quote> If you think a lawyer tax would be a burden on the poor, I don't think you understand it.

So... here goes.... <quote>When you are speaking about changing the law (i.e. to introduce an immigration ban, something that didn't exist), you can't reference the law when trying to argue for it.</quote> <quote>So yes, obviously I understand that in practice the movement of people across countries is heavily restricted. But you advocate for having more restrictions. </quote> Okay. But we aren't actually talking about this, we are actually talking about whether or not it's racist and you specifically asked me where I get that right from, and where exactly this right was earned. I told you specifically where that right comes from, and I didn't earn it. It's how the US constitution and the system of laws here works. You are trying to conflate some stuff here I didn't ever argue and is entirely besides the point. If you want to actively argue about my immigration stance, that's another topic, and we can do that. But we aren't doing that right now, right now this debate is about whether you are moral or a bad person for calling me racist, for having opinions that you disagree with. <quote>Rights are not granted by the government, they exist independently of it. Sometimes the government does not recognize people's rights, and they are forced to fight for it. But that doesn't make them non-existent before they have it.</quote> You are just wrong here. There's not a lot to say except that you are wrong. If a government removes your right to something, you don't have it anymore. Really it's as simple as that... you can fight to get it back, and you can let them take it from you peacefully. I don't know where you think rights come from if not from the governing body that you live under. <quote>Even if you want to use the current state of ""the law"" as an argument....., I'm talking about the world right now, as it is.</quote> Not true either. You should look it up. The president of the US has the specific authority, without changing *any laws at all* to determine immigration halts, bans, and allowances. So no, I'm not talking about making any law stronger. Also, you do not have a right to come to the US. So it's not taking any right away. Where you think someone has a right to enter the US even if we don't want them here, is totally beyond me and makes absolutely no sense. That's where the fantasy comes into play. <quote>A government for the people and by the people means that the government is supposed to serve the people.</quote> You don't get it, and perhaps you won't get it, but again you are just wrong about this. A government for the people and by the people means that the people are the ones in charge of the government, the people ARE entitled to public space, the people ARE entitled to voting for what we want, the people ARE entitled to create/vote/establish our laws in the way we see fit under constitutional guidelines. The people of the US make up the government and we are entitled to all these things through voting, and running for office ourselves. <quote>And please don't extend your views to America or all Americans, because I am in the US, and there are many people who want me here, people who don't think of me and people like me as savages like you do, and people who sure as hell don't want to ban people like me from getting to the US.</quote> This is where you become far too emotional and you begin to lose my respect in this debate. I explicitely did not extend my views to all Americans, I said explicitely, *MULTIPLE TIMES*, that people can argue and debate with me all day and I will respect any person who comes honestly to a debate. I have absolutely no interest in sending you anywhere and I do want you to be in the US if you want to be here, and I have absolutely no interest in BANNING people like you from being here. The amount of dishonesty in this one paragraph you wrote is frankly disgusting to me. You have already admitted that it was not a BAN, it was a temporary hold. So don't purposefully try to make it something it wasn't. You don't know me, and you are purposelly acting like I don't want you here. That is frankly, a shitty thing to say, and you should feel a little shitty that you said it. And to say that I think you are a savage? Honestly, I can't even fathom what kind of shitty person would say that to another person. You know what that says to me? It says that you are actually a bad person for truly thinking that of me, on the basis of what? Because you disagree with my immigration policy. That is just disgusting, I hope you someday feel poorly that you said that to someone and regret that you'd say such a thing. I likely won't be having further discussion about this, because why would I want to even bother speaking to someone who would say such an outright disgusting thing to me? <quote>No amount of mental gymnastics you do to get around the fact that these bans are racist, won't affect the reality of my life, which is me not being able to see my family for the next 5 years just because of my nationality....... And you won't ever be able to convince me</quote> I'm sorry to hear that, really I am. But why do you think that is my fault? Or my countries fault? You have no right to come here unless we allow you here, that is how the world works, and that is how the US specifically works. I have no idea what is keeping your family away for 5 years, but it isn't even Trumps immigration halt. That does not block anyone for 5 years. I won't ever be able to convince you of anything because you are far too emotionally invested and personally affected. Clearly man. <quote>Racism is not an evil thing. </quote> Yes it is, and I'm offended that you are calling my views racist simply because you don't like my views, and not actually because of any racist motive, or action. Because you cannot come up with any racist action, nor motive. You just keep saying ""It's automatically racist and now you have to defend yourself"" Sorry that isn't how it works. You don't get to call someone a piece of shit and then say ""prove you aren't!"" and you don't get to call someone racist and tell them they have to prove otherwise. That is immoral and shitty. <quote>I am honest</quote> I don't think you are actually. Even if the US immigration literally banned EVERY SINGLE immigrant from EVERY SINGLE country for 25 years. It's not racist, and just because it makes people pissed off that they don't get what they want, it doesn't make it racist like you claim with literally no evidence, over and over. You want me to respect you by listening to you as to why a immigration halt, is racist. I've listened, and I disagree, and I've given reasons. But you still call me racist? Well guess what that means... it means you just want to call me racist, cause you aren't a good person I suspect. <quote>What makes the burden of proof on you is that you support immigration bans</quote> I don't paint violent unrealistic pictures of people like you. YOU ARE DOING THAT. I never once said that brown people are violent. YOU ARE SAYING I SAID THAT. So stop lying about me, and you won't be able to call me racist anymore. All the reasons that you simply don't like is what you should say, because they hold plenty of water when you quit lying about them actually. You don't seem to get it, but you don't get to call someone a piece of shit, and then tell them to prove they aren't. Then when they give you some examples, you say ""Hah those don't hold water because I disagree.... your still a piece of shit!"" <quote>You know what's not immoral? The fact that I'm barred from seeing my parents for 5 years. ....... your feelings are prioritized over my entire life.</quote> This is another obvious example where you are much too personally invested and emotional about this. What is really happening is you are telling us what we want, and how we should run our country in regards to immigration to our country, and we are saying ""No, we are sorry but we run our country the way we want to. We are sorry if you don't like it, but it is in fact our country"". And now you are pretending like people have a RIGHT to come here, and you get angry because you aren't getting what you want. OUR RIGHT TO CHOOSE is prioritized over what YOU WANT, and you don't like that. That isn't reality man, and you are waaaaaay too emotionally invested to see that isn't how it works. As for the rest, I'm not going to bother arguing with you. You know as well as I do why you left Iran, and I bet you a lot of money it's because you are legally not allowed to practice your sexuality there. I'm glad you weren't killed for being openly gay, but there sure is a lot who you don't seem to give a shit about who have been killed for it. By downplaying it, and acting like ""Oh it's getting better and hey look *I* didn't get killed"" you are basically shitting on those who were killed, but I doubt you care. Yeah we all know homophobia isn't a muslim only problem, but muslims sure grip it real hard. What is homophobia in the US in todays age? Calling someone a faggot? Getting beat up?

This is my last response, so honestly, don't waste your time writing up a huge response, it won't matter. I'm not going to respond to someone who said the disgusting things you have said to me.

It is false metaphor, because within the field of discourse / discussion there is much more than just intuitive logic, truth and honesty. There is hardly any direct relationship between individuals and discourse. Since there is ideology, privilege, power / systemic power, propaganda, different narratives, social-cultural bias, etc. and these things may well distort the truth and make people believe in things that are false or, if anything, morally dubious.

If (i) is the case, then we still cannot consider the things mentioned early (such as denial of climate change, holocaust, etc.) as *""defeated ideas"".* If (ii) is the case, then we justify the *status quo* and the *status quo* not always have the *best ideas.* So yes.

It fails to take into account noted disparities in socioeconomic status, educational attainment, and racial biases in policing and sentencing (especially on drug policy). It is frequently paired with statistically meaningless but scary sounding numbers, like using the relative proportions of white and black people and basic stats to imply that black people are specifically targeting white people for crimes. So with all of that being said, prople have pretty strong preconceptions about the kind of person who links that stat as part of an argument.

A black person isn't going to be born to non black parents, but a trans person does not need their parents to be trans to be born. So it's very possible for a trans person to be born into a small transphobic community where the near trans person could be tens if not hundreds of miles away. That's a lot of isolation to deal with. Furthermore you are misinterpreting a lot of your links, and some are just plain crap. For instance, the swedish study lead by Dr. Dhejne does not say that suicide rates raise or even stay high for trans people post transition. It says that sometimes trans people still need help and support even after transition. The data shows that the suicide rates are higher than the general populations, but the post 1989 cohort's rates are only twice as high, whereas the pre 1989 cohort's is 8 times as high. If you wish to hear more about that study I suggest you look at Dr Dhejne's ama on r/science from a few months ago. You have an editorial from Dr Paul McHugh, who is basically the definition of biased on this subject. He frequently misrepresents peoples' work, like Dr Dhejne's, and has a clear problem with LGBT people from the get go. He was called upon by the catholic church to investigate the church's sex scandal and concluded that the issue wasn't pedophilia in the clergy, but a ""homosexual invasion of the church"". Johns Hopkins has since disavowed him, distanced themselves from his views, and have reopened their clinic on treating trans people. The Williams Institute study you linked does not show a 41% percent suicide rate as many claim. It shows a 41% lifetime attempt rate, but does not distinguish whether those attempts occured pre or post transition. Since everyone post transition was at some point pre transition, if they attempted suicide pre transition but felt fine post transition, they are still included in that statistic. Saying to shows that the suicide attempt rate is still high post transition is like saying a specific anti-depressant doesn't work when 41% of the people taking it have attempted suicide but never mind the fact that most of those attempts were likely before they started taking the drug.",7761,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[7764, 7761, 7760, 7728]","PolishRobinHood, thank you for sharing your perspective and providing detailed explanations regarding the studies and sources mentioned.

Once again, I'll ask you to re-read my previous example and use empathy to try and understand why this is a problematic situation. <quote>This doesn't resonate with me.</quote> I expect you to make ethical arguments to support this position. <quote>If both people are completely happy and fulfilled with something long term.

Let's shift this to a more pragmatic implementation. A man and a woman are out at a bar. The man drugs the woman, takes her home, and rapes her while she's unconscious. He uses a condom, and doesn't transmit any diseases. He drops her off in an alley somewhere, and they never see each other again. Let's pretend this woman is naive, and doesn't realize that she may have been raped. In your moral framework, has the rapist done anything wrong? The woman doesn't know she's been raped. She has no diseases and is not pregnant, and the man got to have sex.

You think that a relationship where two people are fully happy and fulfilled with it could have ""predatory aspects"" I am saying that is impossible because there is no injured party. Which predation requires.</quote> No, you're misrepresenting me again. The action of a superior exerting their power over a subordinate to pressure them into a sexual behavior is predatory. A person can behave in a predatory way with ignorance that their actions are predatory. A person can be the target of a predatory action, but theoretically not be affected by it and pursue a relationship for ethical reasons, though it's worth noting that the action itself was still initially predatory, because to an outside observer, it is impossible to know whether the victim of the predatory action could ever have consented(to the predatory action in isolation) In situations where a long last relationships where the power dynamics have shifted, we can be reasonably certain that the relationship is consensual and that's fine, but that doesn't change the fact that there was an ethical problems with the power dynamics at one point. I'm not suggesting that someone in this position who is happy break up, and that their happiness be taken away, I'm suggesting we should be aware of the predatory nature of that specific action and understand the ethical implications of relationships and power dynamics. <quote>I honestly am doing my best to argue in good faith.

7878,dpjqdez,7bfx6l,1510183500,Bluezephr,"<quote>I'm a bit confused about the difference between ""act utilitarianism"" and ""rule utilitarianism"". I think if one deeply reflects from the fundamental principle of ""maximize well-being"" they will adopt rules of thumb. But those rules are imperfect summaries and subject to violations if the violations are a net benefit. Would ""rule utilitarianism"" violate those rules if certain conditions are met? And would ""act utilitarianism"" never adopt any rules and not consider long-term consequences?</quote> I'll quote from [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_utilitarianism), you can plug our argument in to this definition pretty easily <quote>Rule utilitarianism is a form of utilitarianism that says an action is right as it conforms to a rule that leads to the greatest good, or that ""the rightness or wrongness of a particular action is a function of the correctness of the rule of which it is an instance"".[1] Philosophers Richard Brandt and Brad Hooker are major proponents of such approach</quote> <quote>For rule utilitarians, the correctness of a rule is determined by the amount of good it brings about when followed. In contrast, act utilitarians judge an act in terms of the consequences of that act alone (such as stopping at a red light), rather than judging whether it faithfully adhered to the rule of which it was an instance (such as, ""always stop at red lights""). Rule utilitarians argue that following rules that tend to lead to the greatest good will have better consequences overall than allowing exceptions to be made in individual instances, even if better consequences can be demonstrated in those instances.</quote> My personal philosophy falls under weak rule utilitarianism. I understand exceptions can exist, but you need to provide sub-rules for those exceptions that can validate those exceptions. For instance, it is not morally wrong to lie to nazi's if you are harboring a Jewish person. in regards to your specific questions: <quote>Would ""rule utilitarianism"" violate those rules if certain conditions are met?</quote> Weak rule utilitarians would, provided you can provide sub-rules to justify them. Strong rule utilitarians would not. <quote>And would ""act utilitarianism"" never adopt any rules and not consider long-term consequences?</quote> Correct. An act utilitarian would only consider the implications of any given act. An act utilitarian would harvest the organs every time, while a rule utilitarian would not, or would harvest only under certain conditions. <quote>If both of those are true, then I'm not either. I'll adopt rules, but will violate them at the drop of a hat if the entire long-term analysis of a situation would lead to greater overall well-being.</quote> Well, I think you can't abandon your rules if you're a weak rule utilitarian, but you can create exceptions provided you make consistent and effective sub-rules. Unfortunately, Given that our current problem, and my A/B example, I don't think it's possible to create an effective sub-rule for our power dynamic situation, or I would personally have adopted that. Feel free to attempt to create a rule though, I may be persuaded. <quote>I mean, what's your answer to the 5-organ question if it is completely secret and will never be discovered?</quote> My answer is no. Though, Individuals having bodily autonomy is a rule that I fundamentally believe leads to a greater overall well being in society. <quote>That aside, I don't think that ""don't initiating sex with your subordinate"" is a required rule any more than ""don't practice jiu jitsu with your subordinate"" is a required rule.</quote> while you shouldn't initiate jujitsu practice with your subordinate without their consent, this is a fundamentally different thing. Understanding that humans and our sexual relationships have a large impact on most of our emotional health is very important. I can illustrate this using rape as an example. Why do we classify rape as being different, and addressed differently than say ""assault""? <quote>Would you also adopt the later rule?</quote> Being charitable, I'm going to assume by jujitsu, you're trying to give a platonic example, maybe a better one would be giving your subordinate a hi-five? Like, I'm assuming you're making the argument asking why sex is different, like, if you hold up your hand for a hi-five with your subordinate, and they leave you hanging, it could have similar implications(the boss could be offended and fire you, etc..) right? To answer that, I'll give the argument that a persons ability to consent to sex is a part of their sense of bodily autonomy. It will cause a person distress to have their ability to consent removed, and having sexual actions done to someone without their consent is extremely emotionally damaging(I'm hoping I don't need to source this for you). Let's merge some of these examples. A Secretary is up for a promotion. The CEO making the decision asks completely for the Secretary to donate their kidney to the bosses child and doesn't mention the promotion. Do you think the secretary truly has the capacity to say no in this circumstance? Do you think it's ethical for the boss to place this person in this situation? <quote>Making non-work components to relationships impossible between the two.</quote> There's a bit of truth to this. At work, your relationships with your superiors and subordinates are always going to be complicated, the problem comes when a person in a position of power is able to exert that power to remove another persons ability to consent in regards to their bodily autonomy. <quote>It is a bit of an untested empirical claim. Maybe allowing these things will inevitably lead to exploitation and worse outcomes. But I don't think that is the case.</quote> Under your ethical system, you'd have no way of even knowing. Victims of rape(not specifically violent rape, but sex where they were did not or were unable to consent) [frequently suffer long term negative effects](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0887618587900247), and it is reasonable to assume situations that are exploitative like this will only lead to further exploitation. If a superior knows that if they achieve a certain position of power, they can pressure their subordinates into sex with no repercussions, there will be individuals who pursue that position of power to abuse it. <quote>I also think part of the divide might be that I don't see sex as strongly different than other components of relationships.</quote> So, that's totally fine. I agree in some ways(at least, if I think what you're saying is that two people who cannot actually have sex can still be in a romantic relationship), but we need to understand that sex is an incredibly strong part of most peoples sense bodily autonomy. You openly admit: <quote>I know I'm an outlier on this.</quote> Continuing <quote>But pats on the back, hugging, kissing on the cheek, making out, handjobs, etc. They're all pretty similar in my mind.</quote> I understand to a certain degree, but are you saying that someone patting you on the back is the same as someone entering your body? This obviously comes back to the question I posed earlier of the difference between assault and rape. <quote>I know how to respect professional boundaries. But that doesn't mean I think those boundaries are fundamentally good things.</quote> I understand, though I think this point is kind of irrelevant. <quote>Typing this out is helping me clear up some of my thoughts on this. Thank you. I think if I did endorse a rule on this topic, on additional one would be ""don't be creepy"".</quote> I'm going to just throw this out there, but I think this is a poor rule. Rules should be built up from your axioms, and clearly defined. <quote>Which is difficult to systematically define and people could easily be confused about when they are creepy. But it would allow the fulfilling relationships involving power dynamics and it would condemn the ones that make people less fulfilled at work.</quote> This makes it sound like your using semantics to try to justify things. I reject this reasoning. What I think you need to do to persuade me, is to provide me a rule that can allow me to justify my A/B CEO Secretary example, and to build that rule up from your axioms in a way that's consistent with your organ harvesting view.

So what are the questions that I will answer in that way? I don't think I'm inconsistent. I have one objective here: maximize the well being of conscious creatures that I care about.

You're adopting this philosophy only when convenient, though given your current abandonment of consequentialism, you're not longer trying to pass off your consent argument as utilitarian so we can move on. <quote>By which you seem to mean that the expectation value of the long-term payoff of any choice can be assumed to be zero and therefore discounted. I said that I do not endorse that and long term effect need to be accounted for.</quote> And no, that's not what I meant at all. The philosophy is that good actions will ultimately bring about good outcomes. If every action we take individually maximizes well being, then we will have a net positive well being. Again, this is a criticism of rule utilitarian, because our predictions of outcomes are not always accurate, and rule utilitarianism relies on predictions <quote>If I'm being inconsistent then I will answer certain specific questions with two incompatible responses. So what are the questions that I will answer in that way?</quote> My A and B examples were those questions, and you abandoned consequential dismissing the outcome and rationalizing it by intent. Now you are trying to redefine consequentialism here: <quote>Intent is incredibly relevant to a consequentialist. First, intent is predictive of future behavior. So if you hit me with your car by accident, my view of what to do about you is completely different than what to do if you hit me on purpose because you're likely to hit someone else again if you did it on purpose.</quote> As consequentialists, we are concerned with outcomes. You can go back and re-read my examples, but in my Example B, the well being of the participants is clearly worse. In my examples I went out of my way to cover these bases and show outcomes, and I didn't mention anything to do with intent because I thought you were a consequentialist. Now, here you are implying intent, and proclaiming: <quote>I don't think so if he thought that she was happy and consenting fully and he was trying his best to maximize everyone's well-being.</quote> So, the outcome is not how we decide morality? We decide morality based on the intent of the agents? I mean, I can argue against this too, but I'm having a lot of trouble pinning down your moral philosophy. What you say it is, and what it actually is seems to be pretty fluid. Continuing: <quote>I don't think I'm inconsistent. I have one objective here: maximize the well being of conscious creatures that I care about. If we can define ""well-being"" in a scenario, you can predict what any of my positions should be with this axiom and you can convince me of a different position by proving that it maximizes well-being better than alternatives.</quote> I gave you a scenario where I clearly showed a situation where well being wasn't maximized, and asked you for a moral judgment on it. You said that it was not morally wrong. This is inconsistent with any utilitarian philosophy. Again, at any point, if you want to build an argument up from your axioms to demonstrate that you're consistent, I'm happy to hear it, and if you manage to rationalize everything you've said here, you'll likely persuade me, as we (supposedly) share some pretty core philosophical values. <quote>You keep presenting this false dichotomy that I either have to embrace "" projections and predictions of the future are too flawed"" or rules.</quote> You're getting defensive. I'm not saying you have to embrace that ""projections or predictions of the future are too flawed"", I'm giving you an argument to show you that act utilitarianism isn't ""dumb"" like you claimed, and being reasonable about my own views(as a **rule utilitarian**) acknowledging that there are criticisms and cons to adopting this philosophy. I don't know how you can accuse me of presenting a false dichotomy when I've clearly stated that I hold this view myself, and that I'm trying to explain that there are pros and cons to different moral philosophies, and that you should be aware of them since you don't seem to have one locked down yourself. <quote>you can predict what any of my positions should be with this axiom and you can convince me of a different position by proving that it maximizes well-being better than alternatives.</quote> I actually cant. See, I would assume that in my example B, you would consider it a moral wrong, given that it had negative outcomes, but there, you said it was not morally wrong because of one persons intent. <quote>But more relevant to what you asked, I analyze the statement ""did person X act wrong"" ask ""with the information available to them, did they act in a way where they thought they would maximize well-being."" I get that we can step back and look at the analysis with perfect information, but I didn't think that's what you meant by ""is the CEO committing a morally wrong action?""</quote> This is shifting the goalposts. I was explicit and clear. ""**In situation B, is the CEO committing a morally wrong action?**"". If you interpret this to mean ""Did the CEO think he was committing a morally wrong action"", well that's on you. I was catering my argument to a self described consequentialist. I gave you the outcomes from the start. Had I known you were only a consequentialist when it was convenient, I'd have accounted for it. <quote>If you just mean ""did the person have a bad effect?""</quote> No, I meant: **""Was the outcome bad""** <quote>Then someone who accidentally kills someone while trying to save them is committing an immoral action. And someone who saves someone while trying to kill them is committing a moral action. Which isn't how I usually hear people talk about things.</quote> What, no? You're strawmanning me here. I gave you a hypothetical with outcomes. You didn't need to predict the intentions of a hypothetical situation when we know the outcomes. Even if we are judging this from the CEO's forseeable consequences, I'd argue it is reasonable for them to be aware of the fact that they are putting the secretary in a position where they cannot consent, but again, I didn't talk about intent. I spoke about outcomes. <quote>If you just mean ""did something bad happen as a result of his actions?"" Yes of course. If you mean ""was he not doing his best to maximize well-being?""

You're playing fast and loose with ideas of both ""power"" and ""coercion."" Someone can be charismatic, that doesn't mean they are in a position of coercive power over another person. Likewise good-looking, funny, popular, etc. As far as money or physical strength go, those are wrong to use to pressure or coerce your partner with. And I would urge you to look into the difference between coercion and *influence*. Please consider, specifically, the power to persuade between humans. It influences us, but it is entirely non-coercive. You seem inclined to call any influence ""light coercion,"" and that's simply not the case. The English language is varied and diverse, we lose meaning when we collapse many different words into single things. It's also a pretty transparent (and lazy) argumentative tactic. Every emotion isn't love just because love comes up a lot. Every touch isn't sex just because sex may include lots of different forms of touching. I feel I see where you're going, but I don't know *why*. Turning your sex worker into your programmer is a bit squicky, but not nearly so squicky as turning your programmer into your sex worker, which is where you focused in your initial post. The latter is ethically troublesome because you're adding something personal and physical (a transaction, perhaps, but personal nonetheless) into a relationship where it was not before. And the trouble isn't that *every* case will bring up problems. The trouble is that humans are messy, easily-confused animals, and most of us are liable to mistreat each other in that kind of mixing-of-roles. As others have pointed out, making any employee a potential sex worker also (a) mixes *your prurient interests* into the professional environment where they have *no* benefit to the company as a whole, and (b) mixes hiring motivations. Hiring double-duty sorts of people often means compromising skill on some of those duties.

7957,dpklrhj,7bfx6l,1510237179,Huntingmoa,"<quote> I'm saying that there is no critical difference between the two that justifies making one illegal but not the other one. Not in my ethics. Do you know of one?</quote> <quote> I also think part of the divide might be that I don't see sex as strongly different than other components of relationships. I know I'm an outlier on this.</quote> The fact that your ethics aren’t universal? Even if we might agree that it shouldn’t be different, that doesn’t change the fact that in the current culture there is a critical difference, and that should be respected. <quote> My guess would be Asians, on average, do tea better. Just saying that different groups will have a different distribution of whatever trait we are sampling for.</quote> Except for regression to the mean. Plus something as subjective as tea would be very different I expect. <quote> I'm bi, so this doesn't work on me. But I still don't get the critical difference. Because people ""feel very strongly about who they receive X from"", X should not be commoditized in this way? So if we feel strongly about who we get massages from, should we not be able to commoditize massages in this way?</quote> I respect that fact that you are bisexual but you must realize that most people are not. Even if you don’t understand what the critical difference is, do you agree that most people behave and identify in a way that indicates a clear preference for one sex vs. another? And people don’t tend to feel as strongly about their masseuse preferences as they do their sexual partner preferences. So I don’t think the analogy is valid. I’m pointing out you are increasing discrimination, not decreasing it, which is the problem. <quote> It is for some people.</quote> I’m really interested to know who these people are, and if they do it as a relaxing experience now, why do you think they need to be paid for it in the future? <quote> Yes, it reduces the well being of the harassed person. I don't like it for that reason. And the fact that it builds a culture of fear and harassment.</quote> So you agree that the supervisor proposing adding sex work to a PD, could lead to the culture of fear and harassment? <quote> Yes, different groups have different distributions of traits. I'm not against different amounts of representation. Right now attractive women are more likely to get waitress jobs or to be strippers, that is ok. Right now people who are more charismatic are more likely to be promoted or hired. I'm fine with them using their charisma to do that.</quote> Do you agree with John Rawl’s theory of justice? Because if so, you should want the distribution of inequities to favor the disadvantaged, and thus reduce the amount of discrimination in society. Yes, currently conventionally attractive people have advantages in business. Why should we restructure society to make that more prevalent? That’s what you haven’t explained. “I’m ok with some discrimination, so more discrimination is ok” Doesn’t really fit with consequentialist ethics that you espouse <quote> But IF it was shown to actually benefit society and him and there was no negative impact (none of which I believe), then yes, I would have to say that's a beneficial action. Things like this are entailed by consequentialism and I am a consequentialist.</quote> See, you haven’t actually shown the benefit to society, and several people have pointed out negative impacts; none the least of which is violating Rawl’s theory of justice. <quote> Typing this out is helping me clear up some of my thoughts on this. Thank you. I think if I did endorse a rule on this topic, on additional one would be ""don't be creepy"". Which is difficult to systematically define and people could easily be confused about when they are creepy. But it would allow the fulfilling relationships involving power dynamics and it would condemn the ones that make people less fulfilled at work.</quote> So you seem to agree that there is some topic that is creepy, and maybe that’s related to the level of control in the relationship. You agree that coercion in sex is wrong, and that consent should be freely given. You seem to agree substantially with my definition of power, which you didn’t yesterday. Here’s mine: <quote> Generally power is meant as a system of hierarchies where one party has a greater control over the other party (so power is the ability and action of exerting control over others).</quote> And now yours: <quote> Right now I'm just going with the very broad definition of ""having influence over another in an asymmetric way."" </quote> These seem to align, if you view “having asymmetric power” as control, except yours is actually broader (which was your complaint about mine, which is strange). You have to realize that coercion is context dependent. If I asked a random person for a consensual hug, I might get a non zero success rate, and it would be consensual. That is to say, people who felt like participating might, and those who don’t wouldn’t. If I said hug or I’ll stab you, that’s leaning into coercion. Power dynamics always fall into a grey zone between direct physical force and completely obligatory actions. When your teacher makes you take a test, that’s clearly something you might not do of your own free will, but you did create the obligation previously to follow the teacher’s class structure when you signed up. Saying “everything has power dynamics so we can’t analyze it”, is throwing your hands up and avoiding the issue. Instead we should look at questions about when power becomes coercive, and how to deal with it. There are already completely ethical things to do about workplace relationships, such as transferring out of the direct chain of command, or disclosing the relationship to superiors for their determination. I’m sympathetic to your initial view of sex being a commodity that can be traded (however I do think those contracts should be voidable in the event that someone wants to back at out at any time, with appropriate clauses).

The articles I could find all say something along the lines of him being let go ""after numerous women alleged the performer made inappropriate sexual advances, or was emotionally abusive towards them"". So it wasn't called a 'predatory abuse of power' simply because he had sex with people he worked with, it's because he was being inappropriate. I don't know what the specifics of the allegations actually were, or if they're true, but this case goes beyond simply having sex with fans or coworkers. To your second point, I'll be honest I'm finding this a little frustrating. You said earlier that you found all the analogies confusing in finding a general rule, but when I try to offer up a general rule definition, you find an exception through an analogy. So I'm not really sure how else to communicate this idea. Is a rich wife threatening divorce wrong? In what context? I wouldn't call it an abuse of power, no. Morally speaking, I don't think it's wrong. I assume people break up or divorce over sexual incompatibility. Legally, I have no idea. I'm curious to know, what's you're opinion on this or any of the other analogies? Do you think this scenario is wrong, or just a standard exchange of power? Simply put, there is no rule I can state, no matter how restrictive I make the definitions, for which you can't find some analogous scenario that would be an exception or absurd. Any rule is basically guidelines on how to act, or what to avoid. Why, for example, a manager should avoid having sex with an employee is for plenty of reasons.

They see others being sued and so the threat of the suit rewards good behavior. FYI, I'm actually against prisons as a whole. No person should be forced into a cage against his will even if he's dangerous. The first option should always be exile. You forcefully remove the bad actor from your society. Prisons ARE a way of doing that but I'm talking about sending them off the land, not into a cage. Then if the criminal tries to sneak back in they are a trespasser and should be shot on sight. But if the criminal asks to come back then the community can agree on terms that the criminal has to follow if they want admission. Like working labor for the benefit of the community that balances out the cost that the criminal caused on them.

This is what you're implying through your proposal of increased taxes and a redistribution of wealth. What you have proposed(through UBI and these social programs) is an *impossibly* high financial burden on the country. The *only possible way* to fund this proposal is to increase taxes substantially(as dedicating the *entire* current federal budget to your proposal wouldn't even be enough to ensure every American is above the poverty line). Again, you have failed to address this basic point. You then argued that by increasing purchasing power(through UBI and reduced expenses via socialization), people would have higher purchasing power. You claimed that this would benefit companies. What you failed(and continue to fail) to realize, is that the money that you've given people to increase their purchasing power has to come from **somewhere**. Regardless of where you get this money(personal taxes or corporate taxes), you will end up taking money from businesses and business owners and giving it to others. While not directly giving things away, ultimately this is what you are indirectly doing through this proposal. I even provided two examples which you(unsurprisingly) ignored. You're essentially making businesses/individual do more work *for the same people* to obtain the same level of income as they previously would have. This is, by definition, giving work away for free. <quote>Schools and hospitals shouldn’t be “corporate” at all. My proposal is DEregulating firms,</quote> The irony in this statement is outstanding. In one sentence you advocate for the increased regulation through nationalization of firms, while in the next you claim that you want to remove regulations. These are not compatible statements. Your ""proposal"" contains a lot of things. Many of which I have addressed repeatedly yet you have failed to respond to: I'll ask again- How do you propose you pay for this proposal without encountering any of the major downsides I listed above? <quote>which I believe would naturally make their goods more available to the people and thus, as supply and demand would say, cheaper.</quote> Again, this is a misunderstanding of how economics work. Yes, supply increases will reduce prices *if demand remains constant*(or if demand increases relatively less than supply). In your *last comment* you specified that there would be substantially increased purchasing power, which by definition means greater demand for products. How far do you expect prices to fall under this proposal? Why?

Science is the process of determining the nature of the universe through the observation of events, the description of trends, and the explanation of those trends; there is no coherent explanation of personhood that includes fetuses but excludes tumors, corpses, and every human sperm or egg cell in existence (there is one that includes infants: a human demonstrably possessing a mind that exists as an individual). Therefore, claiming that fetuses are persons is not scientific, and even then science does not determine morality but merely informs it. Because really, what you are trying to do is prescribe a moral value to fetuses. That is your end goal, and has been from the beginning, because you believe that fetuses have moral value and any logic involved in the situation is an attempt to convince others (and possibly yourself) of that point. This is why, in the end, it's really hard to change the mind of most pro-life people: they've already assumed the conclusion of their argument, so demonstrating any argument they make to be false is ineffective at changing their mind. To rephrase that, from an outside (or a philosophical/purely logical) perspective the moral value of fetuses sits at the top of the argument and thus destroying supporting arguments and supporting logical links should topple the conclusion, but from the perspective of the people holding this position the conclusion sits in the center of a web of arguments for it, at least one of which is assumed to be true, so they hold a non-falsifiable position based on two tenets, a) There is a moral value to a fetus similar to that of an adult human, and b) There is some argument that proves this to be true. Thus, they will continue to believe in the moral value of fetuses even if all supporting arguments are proved illogical. In the end this post isn't to make you change your mind on abortion, because I believe that to be impossible, but I would like you to understand that you don't take a pro-life position for rational reasons, and consider the following question: Is there any logical argument you have, at all, that if knocked down would cause you to stop being pro-life? For that argument, can you state and defend your assumptions and your logical connections, and describe how they lead to your conclusions, in a way that isn't circular and doesn't defy conventional logic?

8569,dpseukm,7cizkr,1510630638,pfundie,"Any respected moral philosopher of the past two thousand years would disagree with you on that first part, from Kant to Mills and even Aquinas. Arguments from consensus are considered to be fallacious in general, and the fact that you're stating this as fact shows your unfamiliarity with the subject of moral philosophy, if not philosophy in totality. There are always assumptions made that are not necessarily logically based in moral frameworks, but these have to do with the bases and definitions of morality rather than specific outcomes. As an example, classical utilitarianism assumes that the maximization of happiness (in various senses ranging from the greek-rooted meaning of fulfillment, or the purely hedonistic definition of pleasure) is the ultimate moral good, and as a result the specifics of what is a morally good or valuable action is determined by the effect on happiness (be it total or average, depending on the brand). This is different from a system that simply assumes that fetuses are morally valuable and tries to work from there, because rather than assuming a core tenet defining what is ""good"" and working from there to determine the morality of specific actions, it assumes the morality of a specific action (abortion) and attempts to determine what must be the definition of good, in order to circularly support the already assumed moral value of that specific action (abortion). Generally in philosophy, even moral philosophy which holds more assumptions, circular logic is frowned upon. The second part I already answered; the simple fact of being or not being part of the mother's body is in and of itself a morally relevant distinction because it pertains to the question of individuality and thus the possession of rights, as well as personhood. Rights aren't central to all moral frameworks, but certainly pertain to the moral philosophy behind United States law, which is part of the CMV. Whether the fetus can potentially survive outside of the mother's body does not have bearing on whether it is, in fact, part of the mother's body or it's own person, any more than a kidney being possible to transplant has any bearing on whether it is the property of the one whose body it resides in, from the rights-based moral framework of the United States legal system which is only concerned with the present state of things and not potential states. The kidney belongs to the person whose body it is in, regardless of whose body it could be in, and the fetus is a part of the mother's body regardless of whether it could be alive on it's own.",8568,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,"[8569, 8568, 8567, 8566, 8565, 8556, 8555, 8554, 8553, 8552, 8551, 8550, 8549, 8548, 8547, 8546, 8545, 8438]","pfundie, it's important to remain respectful and considerate in discussions, especially when discussing complex and sensitive topics like morality and ethics.

8572,dptcvj6,7cizkr,1510682793,dickposner,"(1) i'm addressing your response to my previous comments about moral consensus. Every moral system relies on unproven axioms ultimately, even utilitarianism. Therefore, ultimately, there needs to be a consensus on such fundamental axioms for moral reasoning to progress. If people don't agree on such fundamental axioms, then they'll just have to agree to disagree. No where did I say ""abortion is morally wrong"" is such an axiom. (2) It didn't offend me, it struck me as invalid because it ignores traits in the fetus like independent DNA, ability to survive outside the mother's body (when viable), etc. (2a) typo - I meant militate. (2b) different DNA, different neural system, independent volitional movements, different consciousness, ability to survive (when viable) outside the other, etc etc. It's very simple: list all the relevant moral differences between a baby and a kidney - does your list consist only of ""outside the mother's body""? If so, I would contend that your view on this is in the distinct minority. <quote>rights-based framework of the United States which you have not addressed</quote> This is circular reasoning - you can't use the status quo (current non-granting of rights to a class of beings (fetuses)) as an argument for the status quo. (c) <quote>the basic assumption I have is that potential persons cannot have rights</quote> That is the definition of begging the question and circular reasoning. First, you're assuming that fetuses are only potential persons, not actual persons. But this is one of the core points of contention. Second, you're assuming that any ""potential person"" cannot have rights. This is also a point of contention. In essence, you've assumed away the entire debate, and yet you think your interlocutors are the ones engaged in circular reasoning. The projection is quite breathtaking. BTW I'm pro-choice, but I defend my position on the balancing of the rights of the mother versus the fetus, not denying that fetuses are human beings or that they have any moral value. Your position is untenable because it ignores basic biological truths about the fetus. If you want to admit that fetuses are physiologically indistinguishable from babies, other than being born, but that those characteristics aren't relevant to the analysis of being morally valuable and deserving of certain rights accorded to other human beings, then you're gonna have to give a much more robust defense than you currently have. Currently, all you've asserted is: the fetus is inside the mother, QED.

Again i'm not american the history of slavery in the old world goes from the dawn of time to the present day, one of my countries patriotic songs includes a decree we will never be enslaved that wasn't a platitude people were taken off the coast in raids from the dark ages through to the Barbary states. My ancestors in turn went and subjugated a ludicrous proportion of the world. Americans experiences of slavery are understandably very acute given it was along visible racial lines and thus the legacy persists. It's also incredibly narrow and not applicable to the old world. Escaped slaves who fought for the British in the revolutionary war went on to settle Seira Leon and make heaps of money selling slaves, that probably sounds hypocritical from an american PoV but not to contemporaries, because most of the world has a far longer and more varied experience. I'm not arguing slavery is a uniquely Islamic evil it's the complete opposite of that i'd be surprised if anyone alive today lacks both slave and slaver in their ancestry.

The Sunni who make up the vast majority both in the world, in Europe and in my country lean to the lower ages. Again this is an issue of context. Lots of historical Europeans people hold up raped 12 year old wives but none of them are claimed timeless or in anyway divine. I'll happily put aside Shia they aren't that relevant to the current issues on the continent i live on and tend to be first up against the wall any time there is an Islamist orgy of violence. I'd also consider the Amydia different as they have an extra prophet and are thus as far apart as mainstream Christians and Mormons. TL;DR my ancestors did a lot of stuff as bad and sometimes worse stuff, the distinction is we don't venerate them as prophets.

You have these people everywhere, from progressives to religious nutjobs, on the left, on the right, everywhere, but they are not ""many"". And there will always be vocal people about anything. Regarding your Life is Strange example, I just recently played that game too and liked it for the same reasons many people did, it is very good and seeing female characters in basically every important role is a nice pace of chance. But now you have people who yell ""This game just shoehorns the heroine into it and is just doing it to please progressives!"" and on the other side, there are sure to be people who say ""Well, they were still white and cis and also straight"", but just focusing on one target, the later, is constructing a strawman that isn't helping you. And yes, I see that many films made in the past don't obide todays standards and yes, I think it is okay to call that out, especially because you see how far we have come, even if the film itself was good. I mean, can't you point out racism in old films because it was ""okay for the time!""? No, you should point it out, just to make clear that this is not okay, and it never was, even if society didn't think of it that way some time back. Take the example of racism, 150 years ago (give or take some change), there was still slavery in the US, it was abolished, but blacks were still by no means ""equal"" to whites, it took another hundred years to kinda sort things out with the civil rights movement, but that still isn't changing everybodies mind just because a movement had some success. And inbetween these times and today, we had a steady decline in racism especially BECAUSE progressive kept ""nagging about it"". Somewhere along the line, we discovered that maybe stereotypes are bad, yes, even as jokes, that there is a thing like representation and that there are systemic problems still to this day. With your attitude, you could have said that directly after the civil war ""They are free now, what else do you want?"" or after the civil rights movement or at any point a small gain was made, but in hindsight it is clear that it's a long way and we are not at the finish line.

Second, none of these things would be substantially different than in the present society, except that there would no longer be a capitalist class in charge, but rather the workers would be in charge.

It was also VERY different in effect. Political correctness is a way to establish certain kinds of communication. It doesn't put anyone in jail or ruin anyone's career. Right now, bucking it is often a way to INCREASE one's credibility to certain people. And even when political correctness was more popular, being politically incorrect never resulted in the kinds of repercussions that McCarthyism favored. It's a pretty shallow and poor comparison. If McCarthyism had truly been only about how people conversed, rather than imputing and maligning intent and belief based on the loosest associations, it might be appropriate. Political correctness also is not a solely leftist project for the same reasons that anti-racism and anti-sexism are not solely leftist projects. It may seem so if you're only listening to right wing commentators, but I promise you there's nothing inherently right-leaning about racism or sexism, or left-leaning about designating language as being too racist or sexist to use.

9422,ds9939e,7oflvf,1515203433,Havenkeld,"Should a child be taught not to touch a glowing stove? The problem with saying ""it's wrong to teach children X"" is that people have to live in the world from infancy to adulthood and old age hopefully. This means teaching them whatever worked well enough, rather than what is true, is an important strategy - because the truth wasn't available and/or helpful for particular challenges people had to deal with at any given time in history. Kids are very vulnerable and can't always be attended to 100% of the time, don't have the mental capability to grasp complex truths, and they certainly are capable of getting into a lot of trouble quickly within the moments they're unattended in the meantime. The people who teach children what to believe includes almost every parent, and I'd say ever decent parent, for this reason. Beliefs keep people safe, healthy, etc. They don't have to be completely true to do that, and because children aren't capable of understanding more nuanced and complex truth it can be valuable to give them simplified or false information that simply works to keep them safe until they're older. I'm not saying teaching religion is the same as teaching basic safety lessons, but it's closer than I think most people realize, because people can be very vulnerable to psychological harm from facing ... let's say ""existential"" concerns.... in ~early teen years and religion certainly can help with that regardless of how true it is. I don't think many people are mentally scarred by religion used toward this end, there are some examples but generally it's not religion which is the cause but a particular sect or particular sort of religious family. People who ""brainwash"" their children generally have no intent of doing such and often believe what they're teaching them is true or close enough, or for their own good. And cost seems irrelevant to the moral concern in this case. What you're rushing to do here seems like blaming the ignorant for teaching ignorance, but those I don't believe are the people morally responsible for it, because that requires some knowledge of wrongdoing I'd think. If you hold something to be true, why is it bad to teach this to someone else? I think the answer is that it simply isn't. Any failure has to be in the inadequate investigation into what is actually true beforehand, but that's a much more complicated thing to judge a person for.",9384,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[9422, 9384]","Havenkeld, thank you for sharing your perspective on teaching children beliefs.

You say ""'Give to Caesar what is his,' that law is Caesar's and it doesn't belong to you.""

And since I didn't make up those stories or include them in the Bible as core parts of Christian mythology it's not me you should be blaming for their stupidity. The reason I wanted you to say you are dead serious in this hypothetical is because I didn't want to waste time on a back and forth about not a single adult accepting that this is what you actually want them to believe.

If we can't measure true performance, how can we fire people who are *truly* performing badly? We can certainly fire people who appear to be performing badly according to our method of measurement, but youe claim is that that method of measurement is inaccurate (and I actually agree completely!). So you can't just go chopping off the bottom 40% of the true distribution, because you cannot accurately say which employees are actually, in reality, the bottom 40%. What you can, likely do, is take a noisy measurement of any given person's performance, and you'll be more likely to fire the weak performers and less likely to fire the strong performers. You might end up with a skewed normal, but on the other hand true high performers who aren't rewarded are likely to leave, this is essentially the same effect but on the other tail. The reason I suggest that employee performance is normal is not because it makes my conclusion easier, but because it probably is normal. Here's the kicker though: it doesn't actually matter how employee performance is distributed, as long as it follows the same kind of distribution among both genders. We can argue about what specific distribution it follows all day, but unless you're going to claim that performance among men follows a normal distribution, and performance among women a power law (or something equally outrageous), it actually does not matter at all. You will still be able to detect differences if the distributions are different, even when you bucket. It comes down to this: do you think that employee performance follows a ""natural"" distribution? It doesn't matter which. Do you think it follows one? If you do, then you will be able to detect differences in mean or variance among two subsamples. If you don't think it follows a natural distribution, what you're essentially arguing is that either the natural distribution of male/female talent (or your companies hiring practices filter male/female talent in such a way) that the average male employee is better than the average female employee in such a way as to be hidden by your bucketing system. Either that's the biggest coincidence in history, I mean man, you're picking these performance buckets, and they just happen to align perfectly with the way human skill is distributed so as to make them terrible at determining performance and terrible at comparing performance between genders. Really think about that. If you chose any other number of buckets, or sized them differently, or any number of other options, any of the infinite number of choices, it would show up, but it just so happens that with the 4 lines you decided to draw, they happened to be in places where they would perfectly hide the fact that most of the men are better than most of the women.

Accuracy is the ability to measure an object correctly, to the defined level Precision is the ability of the tool to repeat the measurement, to the level of accuracy prescribed. Reolution is the scale by which your tool can resolve the measurement ================================== A rod is 12.1022 inches long exactly - to whatever digits you want. (infinite trailing zeros) An accurate tool will measure that as 12.1 inches, if it is limited to 0.1"" scale. An inaccurate tool would measure 12.0 inches when limited to 0.1"" scale. Resolution can improve to better describe the 12.1022"" bar but resolution is not accuracy. Precision is the ability to measure an object and get the same result each time. It too has a tolerance as well but expressed as a range. This is factored into the overall tolerance. A precise tool will measure the 12.1022"" bar at 12.1"" +/- 0.1"" every time. An imprecise tool will deviate from the tolerance range over a set of measurements. You combine these items in describing tools - You can have an accurate but not precise tool. (wide tolerance band) - You can have an inaccurate tools but precise. (narrow tolerance band, but incorrect measurement - it always measures wrong) - You want a precise and accurate tool. (narrow tolerance band with an accurate measurement) The last part is resolution. You choose how much resolution you want in the reading. You conflate accuracy with resolution. They are not the same. There is not a statistical tool to increase resolution of a measurement. There are statistical tools you can use to reduce precision error through repeated measurement of the same item. This does NOT enhance resolution but can be used to narrow the tolerance window.

Here is a few biggies to remember Each data point on performance review is a SINGLE, ONE TIME, MEASUREMENT. There is NOT multiple measurements of this. It is limited to a VERY COARSE scale.

Now if you divide the totals by the number of men/women - you are now averaging. You are now entering an area of circular logic. If compensation does not match for a group, is it bias? OR, it is the normal variation in the group for performance? If you want to claim combining people narrows the range, then you need to know what the distribution of pay/performance is in that range. Example - 8 people, 4 men, 4 women Salary Men - 65k, 62k, 55k , 50k. Salary Women 50k, 53k, 55k, 58k Your analysis would say there is bias in pay. My point is your performance review cannot separate out the higher performance of the 4 men from the 4 women because the performance measurement is over too broad a spectrum. I would say their could be bias but it is equally possible that you simple cannot resolve the performance levels using performance reviews enough to differentiate the performance levels used in compensation decisions. Your next argument is over large numbers, it is gaussian/normally distributed. I say - I don't support that assumption based on the selective factors I layed out. It would need to be proven using sampling and higher resolutions measurements. That has never happened. This is where you go off on numerous statistical rules and forced assumptions and completely ignore the issues in the experimental design and data collection. This is where I come back and state you don't have to make ANY assumptions as it is not possible to generate meaningful and supported interpolations given the data you have. So I will leave it at this. There no statistically valid tools to apply to this exact scenario given the data we actually know to reduce the 'error bars' in the data.

Note that chromosomes and reproductive organs don't always line up, and there are more than two possible configurations of each, so a binary notion of sex is too simplistic. But who cares? It's just biology. There is another pattern regarding how people are treated in society. We normally refer to this as ""gender"", or being a ""man"" or ""woman"". This is not determined by the biology of the person being gendered, so we need a new word/concept to talk about it.

9866,dt1kfqd,7s2gzs,1516589722,chris2315,"Okay, so you already seem to have a better grasp on gender than most people who post here about this subject. That's good, it'll make the rest of this conversation a lot easier. So now, let me offer a counterpoint. I'm not going to argue that there's exactly 63 genders. I'm going to argue that there is no set number of genders. All genders are socially constructed. First off, I want to clarify something here. Conversations about this subject often get confusing because we haven't exactly done a great job of figuring out the vocabulary to talk about these things, so we often use the same term to mean multiple things. Case in point: gender identity. The term simultaneously refers to the way people perceive themselves within the social construct of gender, and to what is presumed to be an aspect of our biology that dictates our relation to our body's sex. Simply put, scientific evidence suggests that gender identity is hardwired into the brain, which is why trans people experience discomfort not just with their gender roles, but with their bodies, and why medical transition seems to have a measurable impact on their well-being. Although I'm not an expert so I may be wrong on this, this may very well be a binary, male or female thing. However, the concept of gender identity I just described is an entirely different thing from the other kind of gender identity, which is how people relate to gender as a social construct. Just to be clear on this, I am only going to be talking about the second one: when I say gender identity here, I mean gender as a social construct. Just to be even more clear, ""social construct"" does not mean ""not real."" Social constructs (such as gender) were created by humanity, but they aren't made up by individual people. They're not imaginary, and they have measurable impacts on our lives. I am in no way suggesting that people who don't relate to a social construct like gender in conventional ways should just get over it, or that it would be easy to do so because ""it's not real."" Okay, with all that out of the way, we can get continue. So, gender is a social construct, and a key aspect of gender constructs is that they are malleable. Our perception of gender is not a universal truth. It is not set in stone. For the longest time, our culture's concept of gender was that there were two genders, and that they were tied to the two biological sexes (note that our understanding of biological sex might have been flawed there, from a scientific perspective). This is changing, right now. In large swathes of Western society, it is increasingly accepted that gender is not intrinsically tied to biological sex, and that gender is not binary. Because social constructs are shaped by people's understanding of them, this increasing acceptance is transforming the social construct of gender at this very moment. Meanwhile, other cultures have had different understandings of gender for a very long time. Third, fourth and even fifth genders have existed in many places, with some of the most notable examples including the ""Two-Spirits"" of Native Americans and the Hijras and Sādhin of India. Once you've realized that just how malleable the concept of gender is, and how it is shaped by people's understanding of it, you also realize that trying to establish a set number of gender is pointless. Anyone who identifies themselves as outside the gender binary and manages to gain acceptance for their identity is expanding gender in the process. Your attempt at creating three specific categories is no more valid than anyone else's understanding of how many genders there are. There's just no set, permanent, provable number of genders.",9799,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,"[9866, 9799]","chris2315, thank you for sharing your perspective on the concept of gender.

9880,dt26ydu,7s2gzs,1516630398,DashingLeech,"Actually, you both have a terrible understanding of gender, or even what ""social construction"" means. It doesn't mean arbitrary, and gender necessarily relates to the biological sexes of which there are definitely only two. But, the two biological sexes have binary effects across multiple domains which *almost* always causally coincide with one of the two biological sexes, but on rare occasion have components from both and at varying levels. What frustrates me to no end is that this is literally arguing over the meaning of a word. I know some people think it is more than that, but it really isn't. Whether you call something a gender or just a person with some non-standard characteristics is more or less the fight, but the actual issue people should be discussing is more about what to do in specific situations with people who have the non-standard characteristics. As far as the word ""gender"", think of it this way. How many colors can your computer monitor display? The specs say 16.7 million. But the hardware is only capable of displaying 3 colors: red, green, and blue. So which is it? Really what is going on is that it is about *combinations* of 3 colors. Monitors can display 256 levels of each, which results in 16,777,216 possible combinations of red, green, and blue, each with a slightly different appearance to the human eye. So which answer is correct? Is it really worth fighting over one or the other answer? Can't we simply agree that both answers are correct in different contexts? Perhaps we might call one primary colors and the other apparent colors, but they are related. An analogy to people is to imagine that you have two colors to paint people's body parts: blue and red. Normally they are all either just blue or just red, which we call male and female. But occasionally some body parts are blue and some are red on the same individual. So, is that person a third color? Would it be fair to call them violet since that is what red and blue make? But there are no violet parts, just blue and red. And there is no independent third color, like green. Clearly these people are off-nominal from ""all red"" and ""all blue"", but their parts are combinations of red and blue, with no pure mixture and no independent third option. Let's look at the details of gender. In the context of gender, nature provides two primary genders. In traditional and common usage, the term *gender* refers to patterns in some domain that are related to a biological sex, specifically a carrier of one of two gametes. For mathematical reasons we don't need to get into, there are two and only two gametes: ova and sperm. There is no third gamete. Ova producers are called female and sperm producers are called male. If an organism, particularly a human, produces neither then we have an off-nominal case that does not correspond to the natural selection pressure. We can still use secondary characteristics to assign ""male"" or ""female"" to them from other domains, but that is simple language convention. We have multiple domains to address. On gametes, there are two and only two: ova and sperm. Genetically, the difference is driven by the sex chromosome pair, which is one of the 23 pairs of chromosomes that contain our genetic coding. There are two and only two sex chromosomes: X and Y. Nominally, (1) in the genetic domain an organism with two X chromosomes (XX) produces (2) ova in the gamete domain, (3) in the physiological domain has certain features that include a uterus and typical body shapes, (4) in the psychological domain identifies as female and has characteristic behaviours and patterns of females, (5) in the social domain expresses as female, and (6) in the sexual orientation domain is attracted to males. There are other domains or sub-domains, but these cover enough for now. Similarly, nominally, (1) in the genetic domain an organism with X an Y chromosomes (XY) produces (2) sperm in the gamete domain, (3) in the physiological domain has certain features that include a penis and testicles, and typical body shapes, (4) in the psychological domain identifies as male and has characteristic behaviours and patterns of males, (5) in the social domain expresses as male, and (6) in the sexual orientation domain is attracted to females. These domains are highly correlated. Almost everybody falls into one of these two categories, across all sexually reproducing species, and there are good evolutionary reasons why. But, copying is imperfect and/or there may be other reasons why things don't line up into one of these two categories in some rare cases. In 2-5% of cases, the sexual orientation varies from the norm. We don't fully understand why, but it happens and there's nothing wrong or defective about people in those categories, nor does that status affect their ability to do jobs, be educated, or otherwise experience life differently from everybody else, outside of private attraction interests. In the genetic domain, sometimes off-nominal copying results in trisomy (3 chromosomes), and sometimes it happens on the sex chromosome. Occasionally you get XXX, XYY, or XYY, and even XXYY. But, it has little effect in the other domains. XXX appears like XX for just about everything. XYY appears like XY. XXY appears like XY, though often underdeveloped in some physiology. XXYY tends to be like XY as well. These are just off-nominal cases with no significant effect on life. In the physiological domain, we all start development the same. In the case of XY, at key points in utero, the XY chromosome result in a squirt of androgen that affects physiological and psychological (neurological wiring and chemical) development. Sometimes that doesn't go as normal. Some XY (or XYY, XXY, or XXYY) have androgen receptors that are not as sensitive as normal, resulting in Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome (AIS) ranging from mild to complete. This creates a continuum where Complete AIS has not changed any development toward male characteristics, so you get an XY chromosome organism that has almost all other domains appearling like an XX organism. This person looks female, has female patterns of behaviour, identifies as female, and sexual orientation corresponds to normal female range. But, she doesn't have a uterus and doesn't produce ova. Her vaginal tract ends in a blind cavity, and her reproductive organs consist of internal testicular tissues that do not produce sperm. A simple way to think about it as a first order approximation is that genes decide reproductive organs and gametes, and hormones decide outward appearance and inward identity, and hormone production and sensitivity is controlled by genes, but also environmental conditions to some degree. Likewise the neurological wiring, hormonal sensitivity, and environmental feedback may affect the development of other components like gender identity. (There is strong evidence that gender identity is biologically caused, but whether that is true or not is irrelevant to the arguments here as far as the existence of people whose outside physiological appearance differs from how they psychologically feel about themselves or aligning their social behaviours.) In the social domain, individuals tend to align their behaviours with how they identify internally. Some people refer to this domain as the only aspect of gender, and the others are ""just"" biological sex. But in traditional use of ""gender"", it means any pattern that is related to a biological sex. All of the above domains, and social behaviours, are heavily correlated and with causal mechanisms from biological sex. Unfortunately some people seem to think of these things as independent when they are not. They also tend to confuse the concept of a ""social construct"" with ""arbitrary"", which is not true. Cake is a social construct, but it exists and is popular because it triggers an innate (genetic) desire for sweet foods that evolved in a time when such high-sugar foods were scarce. Now that they are abundant and at our whim, our innate cravings are a health hindrance, not a help to health. That different cultures also have *some* different norms associated with the two biological sexes doesn't create a third ""color"". A few people also extend the concept beyond that, which can become confusing. The concept of gender is tied to biological sex so it only makes sense with reference to two primary gender components (like red and blue body parts above), but in unique combinations. Behaviours that have no relationship to these two biological sexes or primary genders starts to lose meaning. Is ""emo"" a gender? Are ""furries"" a gender? Is Juggalo a gender? If we're going to take all patterns of social behaviours unrelated to biological sexes, then it renders gender meaningless or synonymous with subcultures. But, that may be what some people mean. If we take just the 6 domains I listed above, and each one had a male or female tendency, that defines 26 = 64 possible combinations. With more domains of expression that could go higher. Are those 64 genders, 64 apparent genders, or 64 combinations of 2 genders. That's all wording. The fact is, off-nominal cases exist, and we need to address what is fair for them in specific circumstance, e.g., if they need to go to a public restroom or need to be referred to. What are the reasonable boundaries of accommodation for these cases? It doesn't mean they get to decide everything. We do our best to reasonably accommodate people with handicaps like wheelchairs, blindness, and deafness, but we do balance helping them with reasonable needs or investment from the rest of society as well.

Nuts are incredibly low satiety. Thus they are a bad option for losing weight. Simple as that. Run your own test. Buy 500 calories of chicken breast (1 pound) and 500 calories of cashews (roughly 45 cashews). Eat them as separate meals. Tell me which one fills you up more.

10262,dt688n0,7snmsg,1516812195,DashingLeech,"Oh boy, a lot do undo here. <quote> massive corporations put tons of money into marketing and selling you processed food that's specifically designed to keep you addicted to it. </quote> Uh, no. That's not how it works. If that were true then those corporations could spend the same money and same marketing selling you healthy food and keeping you addicted to it, and succeed even better because they wouldn't be killing off customers, wouldn't be fighting against health-conscious people, and wouldn't be fighting against conspiracy theorists. It's the other way around. Corporations *get* massive by giving people what they want to buy, and what people want to buy in the context of junk food is an internal battle within people. On the one hand, we evolved a desire (dopamine surge) in response to high sugar, fat, and calorie content because these had value for survival and reproductive success in the wild where they were scarce and/or hard to obtain. Now in a time of abundance where we can get such foods easily, those innate cravings cause us to eat too much of them and cause health problems. And, we can also decouple the cues that our instincts adapted too -- such as sweet flavour -- from other components like nutritional value. This works both ways, as it also allows us to feed the sweet cravings using low-calorie sweeteners without the negative health effects. That is, it isn't some massive nefarious conspiracy to make us addicted so that others get rich, and we don't buy these things because of marketing or the food design to make us addicted. It is a purely market-driven process of trying to sell goods, making tweaks to it and seeing what sells better. This will necessarily result in making available things that we desire to buy most. But it is *us*, not them, that are doing it. There is nothing nefarious. The problem is one of biology, our collective prosperity, and the lag between changing environment and genetic adaption. It's not bad people doing bad things. That being said, people *do* have a difficult time fighting their own cravings, as you say. So just because of that alone, we may collectively want to address it by changing incentive mechanism such as making those foods cost more. For people who have the money, that will generally have little effect. The thing I do like about the approach is that it does make healthy food cheaper by subsidizing it so that the poor can eat better and costs are reduced for eating. It's a reasonable approach in concept. However, that brings us to another problem. You talk about food like there are two categories of ""healthy"" and ""unhealthy"". Generally speaking, fruits aren't all that healthy either. They are loaded with sugar, and there are many process foods with artificial sweeteners and lower calories that can be overall more healthy to eat. In moderation, fruits are quite healthy, but so are many processed foods. But there's the problem. There really isn't a such thing as healthy or unhealthy *foods*, only healthy or unhealthy *diets*. Even on a food by food basis, which is healthier: a 200 calorie protein bar with 20 grams of protein, no sugar and an artificial sweetener, or a mango with 156 calories and almost all of it from simple sugars. Another problem with your post is this claim: <quote> If eating healthy was the cheapest possible option, more people would do it.</quote> Maybe. It's already pretty cheap to eat basic ""healthy"" foods like vegetables. (Fruits can be more expensive off-season.) People regularly pay more for junk food already. In many places, like Ontario, snack food is already taxed and regular groceries are not. Also, your plan would be self-defeating if true. If you tax junk food and subsidize healthy food, and people shift to healthy food, there is less taxed junk food, less subsidy for healthy food, and the prices of the healthy food go up, reducing the number of people who buy it. It could shift the equilibrium a little, but it wouldn't solve the problem. So you have a partial idea, but it's already done and doesn't generally work, and not as simple as you think.",10056,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,"[10262, 10056]","DashingLeech, thank you for sharing your perspective on the topic of processed food and healthy eating.

10289,dtapxt2,7sycb4,1517009970,TotlaBullfish,"He is dismissing entire areas of study based on a flawed perception of what they do. He thinks all of those academics and their areas of study should be eradicated from universities. Read the article I linked. That’s what he says. He doesn’t engage with their ideas on any level one could consider deep. Read the r/AskPhilosophy thread on him linked by another user above. He has read a few polemics disguised as appraisals, and has formed an oversimplified opinion based on that, obviously influenced by his politics. That’s not unusual (and is certainly common among scientists of any political persuasion, because they have never had significant exposure to these ideas in their study, understandably), but it’s a problem if he then decides to declare a public war on the “neo-Marxist postmodernists” which he sees behind every bush. I entirely suspect that he has *not* given “due consideration” to Foucault. I don’t think he understands Foucault. I’m not sure how many more postmodernists he could even name beyond Foucault, and I certainly doubt that he could discuss the different stages of postmodern development and the differing theories between different thinkers. If he had ever discussed postmodernism in any actual detail that demonstrated his understanding of it, rather than just treating it like a homogenous, purely evil contribution to the world inseparable from a politics he doesn’t like, he might disabuse me of this suspicion. (Also, dismissing Foucault as “non-empirical theorizing” is....er....revealing.) I did not say that you’re nuts if you disagree with me. I said that, if you think that Peterson’s arguments don’t have their own underlying political intentions (and again, I do not deny that *some* postmodern arguments do as well, like any group of arguments will do), then I really cannot take your arguments in good faith because you have drunk from the Peterson Kool-Aid too deeply. It is possible to recognise underlying political purpose even in arguments one agrees with. It’s perfectly possible to admit that and still agree with him, but if you’re going to suggest that *all* postmodernism is perniciously political and Peterson is a totally apolitical pure scientist (which I’m not really sure is truly possible), then the discussion is going to end here. If we’re going to talk about something that Peterson argues that I think is baseless and only serves a political end, I would start with his attempt to put all of his University colleagues who work in the faculties of gender, women’s or race studies, or anthropology or sociology, out of a job. He says that these disciplines are “corrupt” and “have to go, sooner the better”. Instead of entering a dialogue with people from these faculties *like an academic worthy of my respect would do*, he is trying to get them fired, essentially. Even if he thinks the disciplines are bogus, he has no sane basis for thinking that they are part of a corrupt leftist conspiracy of any kind, and comes off like a conspiracy theorist when he talks about it. Read the article I linked. I just want to bookend this by saying that I do think what Peterson has to say on the subject of the gender pay gap, to take one example, is worthy of discussion. When he is in clinical psychology mode, essentially, he presents his evidence reasonably well and I don’t think the things he says are to be dismissed out of hand (though I think there could be a better spokesperson...). The problem is that he has decided that he must be the foremost crusader against this imagined postmodernist neo-Marxist cabal that has a stranglehold on universities worldwide, and he has decided to take it on with means that are both underhand and *paranoid*.

Except they're not jealous, you're just obnoxious, grow up and live with that fact or change your attitude. The same with spirituality as a response to the fear of death. The solution here isn't to just accept or encourage self dilusions so people can go about their days, it's to find ways people can live life without either being paralyzed or lying to themselves. It's clearly possible, as there's a large and growing atheist/agnostic community. I don't think people in that community have some kind of special fortitude that allows them to deal with reality better than spiritual people - anyone can have that level of fortitude. And there are some real life consequences to denying reality when it interferes with your fantasy comfort blanket. For many Christians, for example, accepting that the creation myth has been debunked by science would shatter their faith, so instead of allowing it to bed shattered and educating themselves and their children properly, they lobby to have creationism taught in school (to everyone's kids) and evolution thrown out of the classroom.

But they're not tied to the atheist/agnostic position anymore than being a Celtics fan is to being a Democrat.

You mention hedonism as one of these ""false"" beliefs. How can the pursuit of pleasure be false? When you attain pleasure, it's as real as anything can be. As real as you being an amputee when I chop off your arm, at least, which is a good measure for how theoretical people are willing to be when it comes to me pulling out the machete. When I see amazing art, hear moving music, or engage in tantric sex, I get pleasure and happiness from those things. How are those feelings, based on the metric of everything that we know to be true and false, false? By the same token, how is altruism false? It's just a feeling of enjoying helping others. Both the good feelings of altruism and hedonism are immeasurably more ""real,"" or at least verifiable, than the belief that an invisible deity with a beard lives in the clouds and will let you dance around playing harps with the cherubs for eternity if you follow a certain set of rules invented by desert nomads 2000 years ago. Even further, you can, as I do, believe that life is ultimately pointless without wanting to kill yourself. You're right in that the universe will go into heat death, that the little mote of dust caught in a sunbeam that we call Earth, is totally meaningless in the grand scheme of the universe and the minuscule beings called humans who inhabit it are exponentially even more irrelevant; nothing that we do or think has really mattered or will really matter. Fine. Agreed. Doesn't make me blow my brains out, because I'm driven by the fact, the truths, that I might get a BJ from my GF tomorrow morning, and it'll feel good, or that I'll save up enough to take a week long trip to Hawaii and get to lounge around drunk on a tropical beach loving life, hell, even that I enjoy this discourse I'm currently having with you. Just because you and I and what we're saying is meaningless in the grand scheme of the universe doesn't mean that it's not real, that I'm not real, nor does it mean you're not real.

I'd like you to compare the claims of Christianity to the practice of hedonism. The former makes grand, unlikely, and unprovable (and very often disproved) claims about the nature of reality; the latter can be measured and codified and studied at a scientific level as we examine why pleasurable actions are pleasurable, and why we, as organisms, enjoy them. We have no reason to believe in the former, beyond wishful thinking and hope, while the latter is a phenomenon as real as anything we know.

10445,dth0u7e,7txrjb,1517332664,chadonsunday,"That is an absurd and absurdly selective definition of what gives life meaning. I'd direct you to the wiki page on [the meaning of life, popular views section](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meaning_of_life#Popular_views) which lists dozens of different meanings in several different categories. Your definition (to live forever) and mine (to seek happiness), are both in there, but they're far, far from the only ones (even beyond the wiki page there are obviously countless more potential meanings of life); you don't get to dig your heels in at your definition and say ""nope, mine is the only correct meaning of life, all others are false"" anymore than I do with my hedonism. Imagine if I approached this discussion from that angle, saying that the desire to live forever is a false meaning to life because it's not purely hedonistic. So no, I reject your definition, as would a bunch of other people because we all have our own reasons for getting up in the morning besides your theory. To bring this back to the OP, the difference in some of these potential meanings is their truth vs their falseness/unprovability. Not falseness/unprovability in the sense that they're not your personal meaning, which is the approach you're taking, but falseness/unprovability in they're not known/measurable by our metrics of what's ""real."" Your pursuit of immortality is ""real."" You can take good care of yourself and we can measure your attempt when you die at, say, 100. That's a real thing. So is my hedonism. You can study how my brain reacts in pleasurable ways when I'm getting blown, for example. That's real. Plenty of the other potential meanings listed are also real and measurable (altruism, to attain knowledge or power, etc.); others, mostly those in the religious/spiritual catagories, are not real/measurable/provable in any sense that we understand those words. If your meaning of life is ""to know God and be with him in heaven,"" we don't even know that God or heaven exist. Or, if they do, that they're the God and heaven of the person's religion. And if they do, we have no idea if anyone ever actually meets God or gets to heaven. None of those things are real, understandable, provable, or measurable, and that's ultimately why dedicating your life to pleasure or knowledge or altruism are more sane and worthwhile pursuits than dedicating your life to something that's not real or knowable. <quote>As for what is keeping me sane - the possibility that I'm wrong.</quote> Your not wrong in thinking that cheating death is one potential meaning of life. However, you are dead (pardon the pun) wrong in asserting that it's the *only* meaning. And it's also rather depressing you've chosen to dig your heels in on one of the few potential meanings of life that you will inevitably fail to achieve. For me, my true meaning of life is achieved almost every day I've been alive, and one can hope that when my heart finally gives out it'll be because I'm old and on my back in a cushy bed with my hand on a tit and my dick in a slit. You, on the other hand, have decided that your true meaning of life is something completely unattainable, and your life is just a march, one day at a time, towards the day you finally fail in your endeavor. I'd suggest changing your goals, man. There are countless true meanings of life that you can fulfill with varying degrees of success and difficulty.

10447,dti2t32,7txrjb,1517369625,chadonsunday,"First, I'd like to point out that you're only attempting to convince me that the pursuit of happiness is futile, and you're not addressing the other two lengthy points I've been making, 1) that it's a little absurd (and frankly egotistical) for you to be claiming that out of all of the billions of people who are, have been, and will ever be, you know the one true meaning of life and 2) that materialistic meanings are objectively superior to supernatural ones. I'll address what you've said now, but if you're conceding either of those points I'd be nice to know. Hedonism is often mischaracterized (as I've been doing to some extent) as lavish, pleasurable luxury, as lounging on silk couches eating grapes and drinking fine wines while being fanned to cool off from your most recent orgy. That's certainly a hedonistic lifestyle, but hedonism more broadly also includes just trying to be happy. I've been using blowjobs as a crass example of hedonism, but I could just have easily said ""trying to enjoy each day and having a positive outlook on life."" So, in regards to the Hedonic Treadmill, one point I think you might be missing is that the theory states that after a particularly happy or pleasurable moment, humans tend to return to a *set point* of happiness. Think of it on a scale of 1 (misery) to 10 (ecstasy), with 5 being emotionally neutral. If you're at a 4, eating that brownie might bump you up to a 6 for a little bit, but you'd quickly be back to a 4 once the brownie is gone. But if you strive to be at a 6+ at all times, which is more readily accomplished by your mindset than the presence of brownies or blowjobs in your life, you can still lead a (fairly) consistantly happy life while the brownies and blowjobs and tips to Hawaii are just peaks in your generally happy life. I might get up to a 9 when I'm eating a brownie while getting blown on a beach in Hawaii, but once I'm back at my day job a week later I'll still be a 6, i.e. still happy. Nobody is asserting that once you hit that 9 you ""gain happiness"" in the sense that you'll be at a 9 forever. But it's quite possibly to stay consistantly above 5 just by having a positive worldview. I was quite the pessimist for a long time, so I understand how that might seem impossible to some, maybe yourself included, but I've been keeping it up for years now even in the face of great adversity, like finding my best friend dead with a heroin needle in his arm. Of course that event plummeted me very far below a 5, but I recovered and resumed my equilibrium of ~6. <quote>If you have more sex, each encounter will be less pleasurable. It will end up washing out.</quote> Yes and no. The presence of so many lecherous old men (and quite a few women) in society seems ample evidence that it's possible for people to find pleasure in happiness in more or less the same thing for their whole lives. And... Viagra. Hell, at my grandparents old folks home they had sex ed classes and free condoms available at the front desk. Most of these folks had active sex lives for 50-70 years and they were still interested in fucking, because they still found it pleasurable. I say ""yes"" because, to some extent, you're right: I blew my load the first time a girl even took my dick out of my pants, and I haven't ever been as sexually sensative as I was then; nowadays, I'd need a 30min gagging blowjob with some ball licking and a finger up my ass to come, but I still like having my dick touched. I need to smoke more weed to get high than I did my first time, but I still like getting high. Etc. etc. Diminishing pleasure returns don't mean you don't still get pleasure, and don't mean you can't still attain a comparable level of pleasure by mixing things up (like with a finger up the ass). <quote>both lifetimes have equal amounts of happiness, since eating the brownie now will lower by enjoyment of future sweet treats.</quote> Not true at all. Firstly because, like with old people still liking sex, there are also plenty of old people who have been nursing a sweet tooth for the majority of their lives. They clearly still get pleasure and happiness out of eating treats because they've been doing it for 80 years and are still interested in having more. Secondly, think of happiness as a graph. X measures the progress of time and Y measures your happiness. Generally, you're at your steady 4 or 5 or 6 (although -1, 0, and 1 would be more appropriate for a graph) or whatever (usually determined by environment and outlook); bad events bump the graph down until you recover, pleasurable events bump the graph up until pleasure subsides. If, at the end of someone's life, you totaled up the average of everything the bar graph recorded, people who had good outlooks and pursued hedonistic endeavors would have a higher average number than pissy pessimists who wallowed in negativity for their whole lives. So no, lifetimes can have drastically different levels of happiness. [Elizabeth Fritzl's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fritzl_case) life likely has less aggregate happiness than your own life, and it sounds like my life has more aggregate happiness than both of your lives.
